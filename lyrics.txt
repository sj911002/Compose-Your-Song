Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
And let me see what spring is like
On a-Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you


Fill my heart with song
Let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, in other words
I love you
And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all, and I stood tall
And did it my way
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, oh, no, not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

Yes, it was my way
That's life (That's life), that's what all the people say
You're riding high in April, shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June
I said, that's life (That's life), and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks, stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down
'Cause this fine old world it keeps spinning around

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race

That's life (That's life), I tell ya, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting, baby
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing
Each time I find myself laying flat on my face
I just pick myself up and get back in the race
That's life (That's life), that's life and I can't deny it
Many times I thought of cutting out but my heart won't buy it
But if there's nothing shaking come this here July
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die

Start spreading the news, I'm leaving today
I want to be a part of it: New York, New York
These vagabond shoes, are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it: New York, New York

I wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap

These little town blues, are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it in old New York

If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York

New York, New York
I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps
And find I'm a number one, top of the list
King of the hill, a number one

These little town blues, oh, are melting away
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it in old New York
And if I can make it there, I'm gonna make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each one she passes goes "ah"

When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes  "ooh"

But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall, (and) tan, (and) young, (and) lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile but she doesn't see
(doesn't see)

Olha que coisa mais linda mais cheia de graça
Ela menina que vem e que passa
Num doce balanço a caminho do mar
Moça do corpo dourado do sol de ipanema
O seu balançado mais que um poema
A coisa mais linda que eu j vi passar..

Ooh, but I watch her so sadly

Ah, Porque tudo to triste

Yes, I would give my heart gladly

But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall, tan, young, lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile but she doesn't see

Por causa do amor
She just doesn't see

Nem olha para mim

She never sees me

Por causa do amor
I know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me
And if we go some place to dance, I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me

Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before

I practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late, and I'm alone with you

The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"

The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"

"I love you"
"I love you"
"I love you"
"I love you"
"I love you"
Some day, when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight
Yes, you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me, but to love you
And the way you look tonight
With each word, your tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart
Lovely; never, ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it? Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight

And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
It touches my foolish heart
Lovely, Don't you ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it? Cause I love you
A-just the way you look tonight
Mm-Mm, Mm-Mm
Just the way you look tonight
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
If you can use some exotic booze, there's a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away

Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
In llama land, there's a one man band, and he'll toot his flute for you
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue

Once I get you up there, where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you so near
You may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together

Weather wise, it's such a lovely day
Just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away

Pack up, let's fly away
I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I tried so not to give in
I said to myself, 'this affair never will go so well'
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well
I've got you under my skin

I'd sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear

"Don't you know little fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality"
But each time that I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin

I would sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear
"Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
Why not use your mentality? Step up, wake up to reality"
But each time I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
Yes, I've got you, under my skin
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles
Will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
Next year all our troubles
Will be miles away

Once again, as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us once more

Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now
My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art
Is your figure less than Greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day
Is your figure less than Greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day
When I was seventeen
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for small town girls
And soft summer nights
We'd hide from the lights
On the village green
When I was seventeen

When I was twenty-one
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls
Who lived up the stair
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone
When I was twenty-one

When I was thirty-five
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls
Of independent means
We'd ride in limousines
Their chauffeurs would drive
When I was thirty-five
But now the days are short
I'm in the autumn of the year
And now I think of my life as vintage wine
From fine old kegs
From the brim to the dregs
It poured sweet and clear
It was a very good year
Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wondering in the night, what were the chances?
We'd be sharing love before the night was through
Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you
Strangers in the night
Two lonely people, we were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello, little did we know
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away and
Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away
Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night
Dooby-doooby-doo and other scat to end
Blue moon, you saw me standin' alone
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me sayin' a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will hold
I heard somebody whisper "please adore me"
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold
Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper "please adore me"
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold
Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
They call you lady luck
But there is room for doubt
At times you have a very un-lady-like way
Of running out
You're on this date with me
The pickin's have been lush
And yet before the evening is over
You might give me the brush
You might forget your manners
You might refuse to stay
And so the best that I can do is pray
Luck be lady tonight
Luck be lady tonight
Luck if you've been a lady to begin with
Luck be a lady tonight
Luck let a gentleman see
Just how nice a dame you can be
I know the way you've treated other guys you've been with
Luck be a lady with me
A lady never leaves her escort
It isn't fair, it isn't nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And blow on some other guy's dice
Lets keep this party polite
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me baby, I'm the guy that you came in with
Luck be lady tonight
A lady never flirts with strangers
She'd have a heart, she'd be nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And blow on some other guys dice
Lets keep this party polite
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me baby, I'm the guy that you came in with
Luck be lady tonight
You make me feel so young
You make me feel so spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual
The moment that you speak
I wanna go play hide-and-seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon
You and I are just like a couple of tots
Running across the meadow
Picking up lots of forget-me-nots
You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung
And a wonderful fling to be flung
And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cause you make me feel so young
You make me feel so young
You make me feel so spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual
The moment that you speak
I wanna go play hide-and-seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon
You and I are just like a couple of tots
Running across the meadow
Picking up lots of forget-me-nots
You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung
Wonderful fling to be flung
And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cause you, you make me feel so young
You make me feel so young
You make me feel so young
Ooh, you make me feel so young
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate to go out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

He doesn't care if it's in below
He's sitting by the fire's gloosy glow
He don't care about the cold and the winds that blow
He just says, "Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow"
(Let It Snow!)
Oooooh-Wee goes the storm
Why should he worry when he's nice and warm
His gal by his side and the lights turned low
He just says, "Let it snow, let it snow"
(I Don't Care!)
The weather outside Is frightful
But that fire Is ummm... delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought lots of corn for popping
The lights are way down low
So let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
(Let it snow!)

When we've finally say goodnight
How I'll hate going out In a storm
But If you'll only hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
Long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
Next time you're found, with your chin on the ground
There a lot to be learned, so look around
Just what makes that little old ant
Think he'll move that rubber tree plant
Anyone knows an ant, can't
Move a rubber tree plant
But he's got high hopes, he's got high hopes
He's got high apple pie, in the sky hopes
So any time you're gettin' low
'stead of lettin' go
Just remember that ant
Oops, there goes another rubber tree plant
When troubles call, and your back's to the wall
There a lot to be learned, that wall could fall
Once there was a silly old ram
Thought he'd punch a hole in a dam
No one could make that ram, scram
He kept buttin' that dam
'Cause he had high hopes, he had high hopes
He had high apple pie, in the sky hopes
So any time you're feelin' bad
'stead of feelin' sad
Just remember that ram
Oops there goes a billion kilowatt dam
All problems just a toy balloon
They'll be bursted soon
They're just bound to go pop
Oops, there goes another problem kerplop
Why do I do just as you say?
Why must I just give you your way?
Why do I sigh?
Why don't I try to forget?
It must have been that something lovers call fate
Kept me saying, "I had to wait"
I saw them all
Just couldn't fall 'til we met
It had to be you
It had to be you
I wandered around and I finally found
The somebody who could make me be true
And could make me be blue
And even be glad just to be sad thinking of you
Some others I've seen
Might never been mean
Might never be crossed or try to be bossed
But they wouldn't do
For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults, I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you
It had to be you
For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults, I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you
It had to be you
The falling leaves
Drift by the window
The autumn leaves
Of red and gold
I see your lips
The summer kisses
The sunburned hands
I used to hold
Since you went away
The days grow long
And soon I'll hear
Old winter's song
But I miss you most of all
My darling
When autumn leaves
Start to fall
In the wee small hours of the morning
While the whole wide world is fast asleep
You lie awake and think about the girl
And never, ever think of counting sheep

When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most of all


When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most of all
Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come
Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
A-Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
A-Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
A-Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
And you're gonna be mine
Put your head on my shoulder
Hold me in your arms, baby
Squeeze me oh so tight
Show me that you love me too

Put your lips next to mine, dear
Won't you kiss me once, baby
Just a kiss goodnight, maybe
You and I will fall in love
(You and I will fall in love)

People say that love's a game
A game you just can't win
If there's a way
I'll find it someday
And then this fool will rush in

Put your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear, baby
Words I want to hear
Tell me, tell me that you love me too
(Tell me that you love me too)
Put your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear, baby
Words I want to hear, baby
Put your head on my shoulder
I'm so young and you're so old
This, my darling, I've been told
I don't care just what they say
'Cause forever I will pray
You and I will be as free
As the birds up in the trees

Oh, please stay by me, Diana

Thrills I get when you hold me close
Oh, my darling, you're the most
I love you but do you love me?
Oh, Diana, can't you see?
I love you with all my heart
And I hope we will never part

Oh, please stay with me, Diana

Oh, my darlin', oh, my lover
Tell me that there is no other
I love you with my heart
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Only you can-a take my heart
Only you can-a tear it apart
When you hold me in your loving arms
I can feel you givin' all your charms
Hold me, darling, hold me tight
Squeeze me baby with all your might

Oh, please stay with me, Diana

Oh, please, Diana
Oh, please, Diana
Oh, please, Diana
And they called it puppy love
Oh I guess they'll never know
How a young heart, how it really feels
And why I love her so
And they called it puppy love
Just because we're seventeen
Tell them all it, please tell them it isn't fair
To take away my only dream
I cry each night
My tears for you
My tears are all in vain
I hope, I hope and I pray
That maybe someday
You'll be back (you'll be back) in my arms (in my arms)
Once again (Will be back in my arms once again)
Someone help me, help me please
Is the answer up above?
How can I, oh how can I tell them?
This is not a puppy love
(This is not a puppy love)
Someone help me, help me please
Is the answer up above?
How can I, oh how can I ever tell them?
This is not a puppy love
(This is not a puppy love)
Everyday my papa would work
To help to make ends meet
To see that we would eat
Keep those shoes upon my feet
Every night my papa would take and
Tuck me in my bed
Kiss me on my head
After all my prayers were said
Growing up with him was easy
Time just flew on by
The years began to fly
He aged and so did I
I could tell
That mama wasn't well
Papa knew and deep down so did she, so did she
When she died
Papa broke down and cried
All he said was: "God, why not take me?"
Every night he sat there sleeping in his walking chair
He never went upstairs
All because she wasn't there
Then one day my Papa said:
"Son, I'm proud the way you've grown
Make it on your own. Oh, I'll be O.K. alone."
Every time I kiss my children
Papa's words ring true
Your children live through you
They'll grow and leave you, too
I remember every word my papa used to say
I live that every day
He taught me well that way
Every night, my papa would take me
Tuck me in my bed
Kiss me on my head
All my prayers were said
Every night, my papa would take me
And tuck me in my bed
Tuck me in my bed
All my prayers were said
You are my destiny
You are what you are to me
You are my happiness
That's what you are
You have my sweet caress
You share my loneliness
You are my dream come true
That's what you are
Heaven and heaven alone
Can take your love from me
'Cause I'd be a fool
To ever leave you dear
And a fool I'd never be
You are my destiny
You share my reverie
You're more than life to me
That's what you are
You are my destiny
You share my reverie
You are my happiness
That's what you are
I'm just a lonely boy, lonely and blue
I'm all alone with nothin' to do
I've got everything you could think of
But all I want is someone to love
Someone, yes, someone to love
Someone to kiss, someone to hold at a moment like this
I'd like to hear somebody say
I'll give you my love each night and day
I'm just a lonely boy, lonely and blue
I'm all alone with nothin' to do
I've got everything you could think of
But all I want is someone to love
Somebody, somebody, somebody, please send her to me
I'll make her happy, just wait and see
I prayed so hard to the heavens above
That I'm gonna find someone to love
I'm just a lonely boy, lonely and blue
I'm all alone with nothin' to do
I've got everything you could think of
But all I want is someone to love
I always knew you'd come along
I waited for you for so long
In fantasies, I've felt your kiss
I knew your tender lips
Would feel like this

I've been waiting
For you all of my life
So many times I dreamed
Of holding you tight
And now that you're here
It's all right
I've waited for you all my life
Now that you're here
For me to touch
The need in me becomes too much
The dream that lives inside of me
Tonight, will be reality

(I've been waiting for you)
Waited for you all my life
Having my baby
What a lovely way of saying
How much you love me
Having my baby
What a lovely way of saying
What you're thinking of me
I can see it
Face is glowing
I can see in your eyes
I'm happy you know it

That you're having my baby

You're the woman I love
And I love what it's doing to ya

Having my baby

You're a woman in love
And I love what's going through ya
The need inside you
I see it showin'
Whoa, the seed inside ya
Baby, do you feel it growing
Are you happy you know it
That you're

Having my baby

I'm a woman in love
And I love what it's doing to me

Having my baby

I'm a woman in love
And I love what's going through me

Didn't have to keep it
Wouldn't put ya through it
You could have swept it from your life
But you wouldn't do it
No, you wouldn't do it
And you're having my baby

I'm a woman in love
And I love what it's doing to me

Having my baby

I'm a woman in love
And I love what's going through me

Having my baby
(Having my baby)
What a lovely way of saying
How much you love me

Having my baby
(having my baby)

I'm a woman in love
And I love what's going through me
As I walk by the seaside
As I walk through the grass
I see little bluebirds
Making love while I pass
Bees are hummin' and they're singin' everywhere
Everyone's in love
Oh oh
I love you baby, I love you so
I need you honey, I'll never let you go
'Cause you're the girl in my heart
You're the one I adore
And I-I I love you
As I walk by the schoolyard
As I walk by the gate
I see the weeping willow
Where we kissed on every date
And carved in the bark
You'll find an arrow and a heart
And underneath it says
Oh oh
I love you baby, I love you so
I need you honey, I'll never let you go
'Cause you're the girl in my heart
You're the one I adore
And I-I I love you

As I walk to the corner
And I pass the candy store
I hear the very music
That I once heard before
Oh how you held me as the music softly played
I was so in love
Oh oh
I love you baby, I love you so
I need you honey, I'll never let you go
'Cause you're the girl in my heart
You're the one I adore
And I-I I love you
I-I I love you
I-I I love you
Good morning yesterday
You wake up and time has slipped away
And suddenly it's hard to find
The memories you left behind
Remember
Do you remember
The laughter and the tears
The shadows of misty yesteryears
The good times and the bad you've seen
And all the others in between
Remember
Do you remember the times of your life (do you remember)
Reach back for the joy and the sorrow
Put them away in your mind
For memories are time that you borrow
To spend when you get to tomorrow
Here comes the setting sun
The seasons are passing one by one
So gather moments while you may
Collect the dreams you dream today
Remember
Will you remember the times of your life
Gather moments while you may
Collect the dreams you dream today
Remember
Will you remember the times of your life
Of your life
Of your life
Do you remember, baby
Do you remember the times of your life
Do you remember, baby
Do you remember the times of your life
I took a little trip to my home town
I only stopped just to look around
And as I walked along the thorough-fare
There was music playing everywhere
The music came from within my heart
How did it happen how did it start
I only know that I fell in love
I guess the answer lies up above
Oh what a feeling
My heart was reeling
The bells were ringing
The birds were singing
And so the music keep goes on and on
And through the night until the break of dawn
I hear a bird up in the tree
I hear him sing this melody
And so he sings
Ya-ya-ya-ya...
Oh what a feeling
My heart was reeling
The bells were ringing
The birds were singing
And so the music keep goes on and on
And through the night until the break of dawn
And every evening when the sun goes down
I'm with my love in my home town
And so I sing
Ya-ya-ya-ya...
When somebody leaves you, that's the time to cry
When you know you're lonely, you're not the one and only
Who will cry?
When your heart is broken, that's the time to cry
When you know she's left you, you'll know that she has left you
So you can cry
Happiness is what I long for
Loneliness is why I cry
For you have made my heart a slave
And now it's up to you
When somebody leaves you, that's the time to cry
When you know she's left you, you'll know that she has left you
So you can cry
In the garden of Eden
A long time ago
There was a story
I'm sure you all know
I'm sure you remember
And I know you believe
The story of Adam and Eve
In the garden of eden
Where life began
Yes the very beginning
Of woman and man
I'm sure you remember
And I know you believe
The story of Adam and Eve
There within the garden
Was they both fell in love
Sheltered by the guiding hand
Of the One above
Life was filled with happiness
Until one day arose
A very great temptation
Well you know how it goes..
In the garden of Eden
A long time ago
There was a story
I'm sure you all know
I'm sure you remember
I'm sure you believe
The story of Adam and Eve
In the garden of Eden
A long time ago
Ohh such a story
I'm sure you all know
I'm sure you remember
I know you believe, yes you believe
The story..
Of Adam..
And Eve
I don't like to sleep alone
Stay with me, don't go
Talk with me for just a while
So much of you to get to know
Reaching out, touching you
Leaving all the worries all behind
Loving you the way I do
My mouth on yours and yours on mine
Marry me, let me live with you
Nothing's wrong when love is right
Like a man said in his song
Help me make it through the night
Loneliness can get you down
When you get to thinking no one cares
Lean on me (and I'll lean on you)
Together we will see it through
No, I don't like to sleep alone
It's sad to think some folks do
No, I don't like to sleep alone
No one does, do you?
(I don't like to sleep alone)
No one does, do you?
There's something in your eyes
That's far too revealing
Why must it be like this?
A love without feeling
There's something wrong with you I know
I see it in your eyes
Believe me when I say
It's gonna be ok
I told you from the start
I won't be demanding (I won't be demanding)
If you have a change of heart
I'll be understanding (I'll be understanding)
When love becomes a broken heart
And dreams begin to die
Believe me when I say
We'll work it out some way
I'll never try to hold you back
I wouldn't try controlling you
If it's what you want
It's what I want
I want, what's best for you?
And if there's something else that you're looking for
I'll be the first to help you try
Believe me when I say
It's hard to say, goodbye
We've lost that loving touch
We use to feel so much
I try to hide, the truth that's in my eyes
(A love without feeling)
But when I feel, we're not in love
I know I'm losing you
Believe me when I say
We'll work it out some way
I'll never try to hold you back
I wouldn't try controlling you
If it's what you want
It's what I want
I want, what's best for you?
And if there's something else that you're looking for
I'll be the first to help you try
Believe me when I say
It's hard to say, goodbye
Don't say goodbye
If it's what you want
It's what I want
I want, what's best for you?
I'll never try to hold you back
I wouldn't try controlling you
If it's what you want
It's what I want
I want, what's best for you?
And if there's something else that you're looking for
I'll be the first to help you try
Believe me when I say
It's hard to say goodbye
I'll never try to hold you back
I wouldn't try controlling you
If it's what you want
It's what I want
I want, what's best for you?
And if there's something else that you're looking for
I'll be the first to help you try
Believe me when I say
It's hard to say goodbye
Believe me when I say, don't walk away
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
Let me hold you in my arms
Let me thrill to all your charms
Hold me, hold me, hold me tight
Tonight, tonight my love, tonight
Love me, love me, love me so
And never, never let me go
Hold me, hold me, hold me right
Tonight, tonight my love, tonight
Forever, I will love you forever
The mandolins are playin'
The moon above is sayin'
It's love, it's love, I know, I know it's love
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me warm
Make me feel like I've been born
Hold me, hold me, hold me right
Tonight, tonight my love, tonight
Forever, I will love you forever, yes I will
The mandolins are playin'
The moon above is sayin'
It's love, it's love, I know, I know it's love
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me warm
Make me feel like I've been born
Hold me, hold me, hold me right
Tonight, tonight my love, tonight
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la.....
Many men came here as soldiers
Many men will pass this way
Many men will count the hours
As they live the longest day
Many men are tired and weary
Many men are here to stay
Many men won't see the sunset
When it ends the longest day
The longest day the longest day
This will be the longest day
Filled with hopes and filled with fears
Filled with blood and sweat and tears
Many men the mighty thousands
Many men to victory
Marching on right into battle
In the longest day in history
Crazy love it's just a crazy love
I love you so but I still know
It's a crazy love
Crazy love it's just a crazy love
What must I do to get through to you
Oh my crazy love
Everything's wrong heaven above
Set me free from this crazy love
Don't don't don't don't you see
What you are doing to me
You upset my heart right from the start
With your crazy love
Crazy love,crazy love
Crazy love,crazy love
I'm just a lonely boy
Lonely and blue
I'm all alone
With nothin' to do
I've got everything
You could think of
But all I want
Is someone to love
Someone, yes, someone to love
Someone to kiss
Someone to hold
At a moment like this
I'd like to hear
Somebody say
I'll give you my love
Each night and day
I'm just a lonely boy
Lonely and blue
I'm all alone
With nothin' to do
I've got everything
You could think of
But all I want
Is someone to love
Somebody, somebody, somebody, please
Send her to me
I'll make her happy
Just wait and see
I've prayed so hard
To the heavens above
That I might find
Someone to love
I'm just a lonely boy
Lonely and blue
I'm all alone
With nothin' to do
I've got everything
You could think of
Here I go again, drifting on my own feet
Lately it seems I've been, being old foolish me
Mumble when I try to talk
Stumble when I try to walk
It's like I'm in a state of shock when I'm with you
Here I go again, looking just like a clown
Everything I say is wrong whenever you're around
Somehow I got kind a shy
I can't look you in the eye
I come all apart inside when I'm with you
Think I'm in love again
Grinning that silly grin
Look what a fool I've been, think I'm in love again
Lately I've lost my mind and I do it everytime
Yes, I know all the signs, think I'm in love
I won't lie to you, I've been in love before
And I think that you're the one that I've been waiting for
I've been around I'll admit
But this time all the pieces fit
Something tells me this is it, when I'm with you
Think I'm in love again
Grinning that silly grin
Look what a fool I've been, I think I'm in love again
Lately I've lost my mind and I do it everytime
Yes, I know all the signs, I think I'm in love
If you'll only say you'll stay with me forever more
'Cause I know I'll never fall in love again
If you'll only say you'll stay with me forever more
'Cause I know I'll never fall in love again
Think I'm in love again
Grinning that silly grin
Look what a fool I've been, I think I'm in love again
Lately I've lost my mind and I do it everytime
Yes, I know all the signs, I think I'm in love
If you'll only say you'll stay with me forever more
'Cause I know I'll never fall in love again
If you'll only say you'll stay with me forever more
'Cause I know I'll never fall in love again
Think I'm in love again
Grinning that silly grin
Look what a fool I've been, I'll never fall in love again
I think I'm in love
Lately I've lost my mind and I do it everytime
Yes, I know all the signs, I think I'm in love
You know I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love
You know I'm in love
I think I'm in love
Here I go againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
I really miss you, will forever more
Let me say the things I used to say before
Always on my mind, I tell myself that I'm only wasting time away
From you, it's true
I need to kiss you, not here at the guard
'Cause I still feel the things I used to feel before
There's no wrong or right, there's only after night
If you turn off the light, I'll know which way to go with you
I was a fool to try to break on love
I was a fool, too blind to see
No, I won't make the same mistake, my love
If you come back to me
I really miss you, will forever more
Let me say the things I used to say before
Holding you like this, the memories with each kiss
Tell me why I miss you so
I can't let go of you
I can't let go of you
I won't make the same mistake, my love
If you come back to me
I really miss you, I will forever more
I still feel the things I used to feel before
The longer we both wait we turn the hands of faith
One day may be too late
And so, we both must know what we must do
Do you miss me to?
Can't get over you
Please don't say we're through
I'm still in love with you
Don't ever leave me..
Don't say goodbye..
If you do, I'll be the lonely one
I'll sit down and I will cry...
Don't ever tell me
Don't say we're through
If you do, I'll be the lonely one..
I'll sit down' and I'll cry over you..
No matter what you should say to me..
No matter what you do..
It would mean nothing at all to me
Because I'm so in love with you...
(I love you)
Don't ever change dear
Oh Don't say we're through
If you do, I'll be the lonely one
And I'll sit down and I'll cry over you...
Oh I'll sit down and I'll cry over you...
you say you're lonely
You cried the long night through
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you
Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried, cried, cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember, all that you said
You told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me and

Now you say, you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
Cause I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, remember, all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me and
Now, now you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Come on and cry, cry, cry me a river, cry me a river
Cause I cried a river over you
If my pillow could talk, imagine what it would have said
Could it be a river of tears I cried in bed?
So you can cry me a river
Daddy, go ahead and cry that river
Cause I cried, how I cried a river over you
How I cried a river over you
Summertime and the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high
Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'
So hush little baby, don't you cry

One of these mornings
You're gonna rise up singing
Yes you'll spread your wings
And you'll take to the sky
But 'til that morning
There ain't nothin' can harm you
With Daddy and Mammy standin' by

Summertime, and the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high
Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'
So hush little baby, don't you cry
Oh don't you cry
Oh don't you cry
Don't you cry
Oh don't you cry
After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no Bromo-Seltzer handy
I don't even shake
Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink
I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me
I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms
Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink
I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get, off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best
Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more
Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more
Couldn't eat, was dispeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic
Since you moved out of there
Romance, finis. Your chance, finis
Those ants that invaded my pants, finis
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more
Love is like a never-ending melody
Always have compared it to a symphony
A symphony conducted by the lighting of the moon
But our song of love is slightly out of tune
Once your kisses raised me to a fever pitch
Now the orchestration doesn't seem so rich
Seems to me you've changed the tune we used to sing
Like the bossa nova, love should swing
We used to harmonize, two souls in perfect time
Now the lyrics and the melody don't even rhyme
For you forgot the melody our hearts would always croon
And so what good's a heart that's slightly out of tune
Tune your heart to mine the way it used to be
Join with me in harmony and sing a song of loving
We've got to be together and before too long
There'll be no desafinado
When you give your heart  to me completely
Then you won't be slightly out of tune
You'll sing along with me
There'll be no desafinado
When you give your heart  to me completely
You won't be slightly out of tune
You'll sing along with me
Look at me, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree;
And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, just holding your hand
Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty, the moment you're near
Can't you see that you're leading me on?
And it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you
On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love
Too misty
And too much
In love
Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street
I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over
If I never have a cent
I'll be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover has crossed over
If I never, never have a cent
I'll be rich as Rockefeller
With gold dust at my feet
On a sunny, sunny side of the street
On a sunny, sunny side of the street
There's a saying old, says that love is blind
Still we're often told, "seek and ye shall find"
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret

I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longin' to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some girls think of as handsome
To my heart, he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed?
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed?
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Someone to watch over me
When the bells all ring and the horns all blow
And the couples we know are fondly kissing
Will I be with you or will I be among the missing?
Maybe it's much too early in the game
Ah, but I thought I'd ask you just the same
What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?
Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight
When it's exactly twelve o'clock that night
Welcoming in the New Year, New Year's Eve
Maybe I'm crazy to suppose
I'd ever be the one you chose
Out of the thousand invitations you received
Ah, but in case I stand one little chance
Here comes the jackpot question in advance
What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?
Oh, what are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?
My heart is sad and lonely!
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it?
I'm all for you, Body and Soul
I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you, I mean it
I'm all for you, Body and Soul!
I can't believe it
Its hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending?
It looks like the ending!--
Unless, I can have
One more chance to prove dear..
My life a wreck you're making!
You know I'm yours
For just the taking
I'd gladly surrender
Myself to you, Body and Soul!
Behold the way our fine feathered friend
His virtue doth parade
Thou knowest not, my dim-witted friend
The picture thou hast made
Thy vacant brow, and thy tousled hair
Conceal thy good intent
Thou noble upright truthful sincere
And slightly dopey gent
You're my funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable
Yet, you're my favorite work of art
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are you smart?
But, don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine, stay!
Each day is Valentine's Day
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are you smart?
But, don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine, stay!
Each day is Valentine's Day
All of me, why not take all of me?
Baby, can't you see I'm no good without you?
Take my lips, I'll never use them
Take my arms, I want to lose them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
Tell me how can I go on, dear, without you?
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me?
All of me, why not take all of me?
Can't you see I'm no good without you?
Take my lips, I want to lose 'em
Take my arms, I'll never use them
Your g-g-goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on, dear, without you?
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me?
Come on and take, take all of me
"Our romance won't end on a sorrowful note
Though by tomorrow you're gone
The song has ended but as the songwriter wrote
The melody lingers on
They may take you from me
I'll miss your fond caress
But though they take you from me
I'll still possess...
The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No they can't take that away from me
The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no they can't take that away from me
We may never never meet again, on that bumpy road to love
Still I'll always, always keep the memory of
The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, no they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me."
Mmmmm
I've got a crush on someone, guess who?
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh
I never had the least notion
That I could fall with so much emotion
Could you coo? Could you care?
For a cunning cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I've got a crush, my baby, on you
How glad a million laddies
From millionaires to caddies
Would be to capture me
But you had such persistence
You wore down my resistance
I fell and it was swell
You're my big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you, I shall never never know
It's not that you're attractive
But, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh
I never had the least notion
That I could fall with so much emotion
Could you coo? Could you care?
For a cunning cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I've got a crush, my baby, on you
Oops, my heart went oops
The moment that we met my heart went oops
I never will forget my heart turned hoops
The moment that I met you
Oops, my feet went oops
I nearly took a spill--my knees went oops
They shook up it until my head went oops
You must'nt let it get you
I was going for a very
Choo'd call a solitary sorta stroll
Just a twiddle of my thumb
When I heard a lot of drums begun to pound and roar
And, oops, my heart went oops
It went into a spin of loop-di-loops
You must've thought me kin to nincompoops
The silly way I acted
Of course you wouldn't know
That you were so a-glow
And I was so attracted
But, baby, take a bow
My heart is going oops right now
Pops, you are the tops
The moment that my eyes behold your chops
You lift me to the skies, my heart flip-flops
You shouldn't make it make like that
Bell, my buxom bell
I'm still in love with you 'cause truth tell
You always kinda knew that we would gel
'Cause jam could never shake like that
I was going for a frantic
But completely unromantic sorta drive
But I knew you wouldn't quit
When I dug you and you hit me with that old time jive
(Sing it, Ella)
Then, oops, my heart went oops
Sitting on the stoops, the local droops
They nearly flipped their tops, I mean, in groups
The silly way we acted
Of course they couldn't know
That you were so a-glow
And I was so attracted
Yes, baby, take a bow
My heart is going oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, right now
Oops, oops, then
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Yes, heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I'd love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I'd love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Now, mama, dance with me
I want my arms about you
The charms about you
Will carry me through, yes
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
(Sing it Ella, swing it)
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I'd love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Come on and dance with me
I want my arm about you
The charm about you
Will carry me through to
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Yes, dance with me
I want my arm(s) about you
The charm(s) about you
Will carry me through to
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Cheek to cheek
Cheek to cheek
Cheek to cheek
I'm discontented with homes that I've rented
So I have invented my own
Darling, this place is lovely oasis
Where life's weary taste is unknown
Far from the crowded city
Where flowers pretty caress the stream
Cozy to hide in, to live side by side in
Don't let it apart in my dream
Picture me upon your knee
Just tea for two
And two for tea
Just me for you
And you for me alone
Nobody near us to see us or hear us
No friends or relations
On weekend vacations
We won't have it known
That we own a telephone, dear
Day will break and I'll wake
And start to bake a sugar cake
For you to take for all the boys to see
We will raise a family
A boy for you
And a girl for me
Can't you see how happy we would be
Picture you upon my knee
Just tea for two
And two for tea
Just me for you
And you for me alone
Nobody near us to see us or hear us
No friends or relations
On weekend vacations
We won't have it known
That we own a telephone, dear
Day will break, you'll wake
And start to bake a sugar cake
For you to take for all the boys to see
We will raise a family
A boy for you
And a girl for me
You say it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make believe
If you believed in me
Yes, its only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade
It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

You say its only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make believe
If you believed in me
Yes, its only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade
It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me
But it wouldn't be make-believe
Believe if you believed in me
Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no love
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon
How high the moon
Is the name of this song
How high the moon
Though the words may be wrong
We're singing it
Because you ask for it
So we're swinging it just for you
How high the moon
Does it touch the stars
How high the moon
Does it reach up to Mars
Though the words may be wrong
To this song
We're asking how high, high, high
High, high is the moon

We hope to make high, high, high, high
High as the moon
Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee
A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous, he answers twice
Its really killin' that he's so willin'
To make whoopee
Now picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring
He's washing dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious, he even sews
But don't forget, folks
Thats what you get, folks, for makin' whoopee
Another year or maybe less
What's this I hear? Well, you can't confess
She feels neglected and he's suspected
Of makin' whoopee
She sits alone most every night
He doesn't phone her, he doesn't write
He says he's busy, buut she says, "is he?"
He's makin' whoopee
He doesn't make much money
Only five thousand per
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, "You'll pay six to her"
He says, "Now judge, suppose I fail?"
The judge say, "Budge right into jail
You'd better keep her, I think it's cheaper
Than makin' whoopee
You'd better keep her, I think it's cheaper
Than makin' whoopee"
I try to think that love's not around
But it's uncomfortably near
My ol' heart ain't gaining no ground
Because my angel eyes ain't here
Angel eyes, that old Devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's misspent
Misspent with angel eyes tonight
So drink up all you people
Order anything you see
Have fun you happy people
The laugh's and the joke's on me
Pardon me but I got to run
The facts uncommonly clear
Got to find who's now number one
And why my angel eyes
Oh, where is my angel eyes?
'Scuse me while I disappear
Angel eyes
Alone together, beyond the crowd
Above the world, were not too proud
To cling together, were strong
As long as were together
Alone together, the blinding rain
The starless night, were not in vain
For were together and what is there
To fear together
Our love is as deep as the sea
Our love is as great as a love can be
And we can weather the great unknown
If were alone together
Like the beat beat beat of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you
Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter darling where you are
I think of you
Night and day
Day and night, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Night and day
Night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
And its torment won't be through
'til you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day
I don't believe in superstars
Organic food and foreign cars
I don't believe the price of gold
The certainty of growing old
That right is right and left is wrong
That north and south can't get along
That east is east and west is west
And being first is always best

But I believe in love
I believe in babies
I believe in mom and dad
And I believe in you

Well I don't believe that heaven waits
For only those who congregate
I like to think of God as love
He's down below, he's up above
He's watchin' people, everywhere
He knows who does and doesn't care
And I'm an ordinary man
Sometimes I wonder who I am
But I believe in love
I believe in music
I believe in magic
And I believe in you

I know with all my certainty
What's going on with you and me
Is a good thing
It's true
I believe in you

I don't believe virginity
Is as common as it used to be
In working days and sleeping nights
That black is black and white is white
That Superman and Robin Hood
Are still alive in Hollywood
That gasoline's in short supply
The rising cost of gettin' by

But I believe in love
I believe in old folks
I believe in children
I believe in you
I believe in love
I believe in babies
I believe in mom and dad
And I believe in you
Coffee black, cigarettes
Start this day, like all the rest
First thing every morning that I do
Is start missing you
Some broken hearts never mend
Some memories never end
Some tears will never dry
My love for you will never die
Rendezvous in the night
A willing woman to hold me tight
But in the middle of love's embrace
I see your face
Some broken hearts never mend
Some memories never end
Some tears will never dry
My love for you will never die
You placed gold on my finger
You brought love like I've never known
You gave life to our children
And to me a reason to go on

You're my bread when I'm hungry
You're my shelter from troubled winds
You're my anchor in life's ocean
But most of all you're my best friend

When I need hope and inspiration
You're always strong when I'm tired and weak
I could search this whole world over
You'd still be everything that I need

You're my bread when I'm hungry
You're my shelter from troubled winds
You're my anchor in life's ocean
But most of all you're my best friend

You're my bread when I'm hungry
You're my shelter from troubled winds
You're my anchor in life's ocean
But most of all you're my best friend

Lord, I hope this day is good
I'm feelin' empty and misunderstood
I should be thankful, Lord, I know I should
But Lord I hope this day is good
Lord, have you forgotten me
I've been prayin' to you faithfully
I'm not sayin' I'm a righteous man
But Lord I hope you understand
I don't need fortune and I don't need fame
Send down the thunder, Lord, send down the rain
But when you're plannin' just how it will be
Plan a good day for me
Lord, I hope this day is good
I'm feelin' empty and misunderstood
I should be thankful, Lord, I know I should
But Lord I hope this day is good
You've been the King since the dawn of time
All that I'm askin' is a little less crime
It might be hard for the devil to do
But it would be easy for you
Lord, I hope this day is good
I'm feelin' empty and misunderstood
I should be thankful, Lord, I know I should
But Lord I hope this day is good
I've held it all inward
Lord knows I've tried
It's an awful awakenin'
In a country boy's life
To look in the mirror
In total surprise
At the hair on your shoulders
And the age in your eyes

Amanda, light of my life
Fate should've made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
Fate should've made you a gentleman's wife

There's a measure of people
That don't understand
The pleasures of life
In a hillbilly band
I got my first guitar
When I was fourteen
Now I'm over thirty
And still wearing jeans
Amanda, light of my life
Fate should've made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
Fate should've made you a gentleman's wife
When I was a kid Uncle Remus he put me to bed
With a picture of Stonewall Jackson above my head
Then daddy came in to kiss his little man
With gin on his breath and a Bible in his hand
He talked about honor and things I should know
Then he staggered a little as he went out the door

I can still hear the soft southern winds in the live oak trees
And those Williams boys, they still mean a lot to me
Hank and Tennessee
I guess we're all gonna be what we're gonna be
So, what do you do with good ole boys like me?

Nothing makes a sound in the night like the wind does
But you ain't afraid if you're washed in the blood like I was
The smell of Cape Jasmine through the window screen
John R. and the Wolfman kept me company
By the light of the radio by my bed
With Thomas Wolfe whispering in my head

I can still hear the soft southern winds in the live oak trees
And those Williams boys, they still mean a lot to me
Hank and Tennessee
I guess we're all gonna be what we're gonna be
So, what do you do with good ole boys like me?
When I was in school I ran with a kid down the street
And I watched him burn himself up on Bourbon and speed
But I was smarter than most and I could choose
Learned to talk like the man on the six o'clock news
When I was eighteen Lord I hit the road
But it really doesn't matter how far I go

I can still hear the soft southern winds in the live oak trees
And those Williams boys, they still mean a lot to me
Hank and Tennessee
I guess we're all gonna be what we're gonna be
So, what do you do with good ole boys like me?
Yeah, what do you do with good ole boys like me?
First I get cold then hot
Think I'm on fire
But I'm not
Oh, what a pain I've got
It must be love
There's nothin' I can do
All that I want is you
Look what I'm goin' through
It must be love
It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
Fly like a dove
You must be the dream
I've been dreamin' of
Oh, what a feelin'
It must be love
Somethin' is wrong, alright
I think of you all night
Can't sleep till mornin' light
It must be love
Seein' you in my dreams
Feelin' you close to me
Oh, what eles can it be?
It must be love
It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
Fly like a dove
You must be the dream
I've been dreamin' of
Oh, what a feelin'
It must be love
It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
Fly like a dove
You must be the dream
I've been dreamin' of
Oh, what a feelin'
It must be love
It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
Fly like a dove
You must be the dream
I've been dreamin' of
Oh, what a feelin'
It must be love...
(Spoken)
Back in the innocent days
There was a young Cowboy
Who was in love with a Mexican girl
Only she didn't know it
And he would watch her when she walked back
In the cotton dress which danced in the wind
And her eyes held the stars
Now, she was the most beautiful thing that cowboy had ever seen
Sent down straight from heaven
But he was afraid he would never win her heart
Cause of some family scars left by the rain forest
But oww... how he loved her
Senorita passing by
Pardon me if I stop and ask you why
Senorita, could it be?
Someone like you could love someone like me?
--- Instrumental ---
(Spoken)
So he walked up to her
Tipped his hat and introduced himself
And she looked up at him and didn't know what to say
So he told her the story of his family
The trouble that brought the barbed wire
And all the things that he couldn't change
And then he told her that he loved her
And he studied her reaction
And by the time the spring rains came
They were married
Now, there's an ol' song
That my family used to sing
'Bout a young cowboy and a mexican girl
And how they fell in love
Senorita passing by
Pardon me if I stop and ask you why
Senorita, could it be?
Someone like you could love someone like me
Senoritra passing by
Pardon me if I stop and ask you why
Senorita, could it be?
Someone like you could love someone like
Someone like you could love someone like me
If I needed you, would you come to me?
Would you come to me for to ease my pain?
If you needed me, I would come to you
I would swim the sea for to ease your pain

Well the night's forlorn and the morning's born
And the morning's born with the lights of love
And you'll miss sunrise if you close your eyes
And that would break my heart in two

If I needed you, would you come to me?
Would you come to me for to ease my pain?
If you needed me, I would come to you
I would swim the sea for to ease your pain


Baby's with me now since I showed her how
To lay her lily hand in mine
Who could ill agree she's a sight to see
A treasure for the poor to find
If I needed you, would you come to me?
Would you come to me for to ease my pain?
If you needed me, I would come to you
I would swim the sea for to ease your pain
I left Oklahoma, drivin' in a Pontiac
Just about to lose my mind
I was goin' to Arizona, maybe on to California
Where the people all live so fine

My baby said, I's crazy, my mama called me lazy
I was gonna show 'em all this time
'Cause you know I ain't no fool and I don't need no more schoolin'
I was born to just walk the line

Livin' on Tulsa time, livin' on Tulsa time
Well, you'll know I been through it
When I set my watch back to it
Livin' on Tulsa Time

Well, there I was in Hollywood, wishin' I was doin' good
Talkin' on the telephone line
But they don't need me in the movies and nobody sings my songs
Guess, I'm just a wastin' time

Well, then I got to thinkin', man I'm really sinkin'
An' I really had a flash this time
I had no business leavin' an' nobody would be grievin'
If I went on back to Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa time, livin' on Tulsa time
Gonna set my watch back to it
'Cause you know I been through it
Livin' on Tulsa time

Livin' on Tulsa time, livin' on Tulsa time
Gonna set my watch back to it
'Cause you know I been through
Livin' on Tulsa time
I guess as a lover I have a ways to go
When someone wants you they should just say it's so
But you'll understand if you'll take my hand
And then we can dance real slow
To something on the radio
Listen to the radio
Oh, listen to the radio
'Let's spend the night together
Baby don't go'
They sing it on the radio
I try to find a way to explain to you
What's on my mind and not sound so plain to you
But you'll realize if you close your eyes
The feelings my words can't show
They're playing on the radio
(Repeat chorus)
The words I'd say
Don't seem to sound as real
The songs they play
That's how I really feel, so
(Repeat chorus)
Silver coins that jingle jangle
Fancy shoes that dance in time
Oh, the secrets of her dark eyes
They did sing a gypsy rhyme
Yellow clover in tangled blossoms
In a meadow silky green
Where she held me to her bosom
Just a boy of seventeen
I recall a gypsy woman
Silver spangles in her eyes
Ivory skin against the moonlight
And the taste of life's sweet wine
Soft breezes blow from fragrant meadows
And stir the darkness in my mind
Oh, gentle woman you sleep beside me
Little know who haunts my mind
Gypsy lady, I hear your laughter
And it dances in my head
While my tender wife and babies
Slumber softly in their beds
I recall a gypsy woman
Silver spangles in her eyes
Ivory skin against the moonlight
And the taste of life's sweet wine...
I ain't gonna marry in the fall
I ain't gonna marry in the spring
'Cause I'm in love with a pretty little girl
Who wears a diamond ring
And I'm just a country boy
Money have I none
But I've got silver in the stars
Gold in the mornin' sun
Gold in the mornin' sun
Never gonna kiss
The ruby red lips
Of the prettiest girl in town
Never gonna ask her if she'd
Marry me
I know she'd turn me down
'Cause I'm just a country boy
Money have I none
But I've got silver in the stars
And gold in the mornin' sun
Gold in the mornin' sun
I never could afford
A store bought ring
With a sparkling diamond stone
All I could afford
Is a loving heart
The only one I own
'Cause I'm just a country boy
Money have I none
But I've got silver in the stars
And gold in the mornin' sun
Gold in the mornin' sun...
I've spent my life looking for you
Finding my way wasn't easy to do
But I knew there was you all the while
And it's been worth every mile

So lay down beside me
Love me and hide me
Kiss all the hurtin' of this world away
Hold me so close that I feel your heartbeat
And don't ever wander away

Mornings and evenings all were the same
And there was no music till I heard your name
But I knew when I saw you smile
Now I can rest for awhile

So lay down beside me
Love me and hide me
Kiss all the hurtin' of this world away
Hold me so close that I feel your heartbeat
And don't ever wander away
Well you know I'm not much good at writin' letters
So I gave up and decided that I'd call
Naw' there's really not much new to tell ya
Things back here they never change at all
It snowed today, it's cold here for November
But I hear the weather's warm out there
Oh, and if you see Burt Reynolds
Would you shake his hand for me
And tell ol' Burt , I've seen all his movies
Well, I hope you make the big time
I hope your dreams come true
But if Hollywood don't need you
Honey I still do
Last night I drove the truck to Amarillo
Some friends and I we had a laugh or two
But lately we don't cut up like we used to
'Cause all that I can think about is you
Well, I know this is what you've always wanted
But I know now that all I want is you
So if you see Burt Reynolds
Would you shake his hand for me
And tell ol' Burt , I've seen all his movies
Well, I hope you make the big time
I hope your dreams come true
But if Hollywood don't need you
Honey I still do
If Hollywood don't need you
Honey, I still do
(O'Hara/Welch)
My heart is out of control
This ol' love struck so
Just lives for the moment you're around
When I hold on to you
It is all I can do
Just to keep my feet on the ground
Desperately
Loving you desperately
When you are not here with me
I get a little bit crazy
Constantly
Think about you constantly
Look at what you done to me
I'm just like a little baby
Oh, I love you desperately
--- Instrumental ---
Will I laugh?
Will I cry?
Will I live?
Will I die?
It all depends upon you
And it is dangerous
I know
To be lost in you so
But I'm that
There's nothing I can do
Desperately
Loving you desperately
When you are not here with me
I get a little bit crazy
Constantly
Think about you constantly
Look at what you done to me
I'm just like a little baby
Oh, I love you desperately
Desperately
Loving you desperately
When you are not here with me
I get a little bit crazy
Constantly
Think about you constantly
Look at what you done to me
I'm just like a little baby
Oh, I love you desperately
(Bob McDill / Paul Harrison)
Darling, if you ever leave me
Well, I'll just put my heart away
I couldn't love again, believe me
No one could please me anyway
And if another ever came along
I'd just turn them down 'cause after all
I've been loved by the best
I can't settle now for less
Why bother with the rest
Baby, I've been to the top, I guess
With you I have been blessed
I won't take nothin' less
I've been loved by the best
If you ever get tired of me
Well, I won't look for someone new
'Cause looking back on how you loved me
No one could measure up to you
And if they try to win this heart of mine
I just have to say, a waste if time
I've been loved by the best
I can't settle now for less
Why bother with the rest
Baby, I've been to the top, I guess
With you I have been blessed
I won't take nothin' less
I've been loved by the best
When I look into your eyes I know
You're the only love I ever want
'Cause, after you and me
Baby, I can see
Nothin' else could be even close
I've been loved by the best
I can't settle now for less
Why bother with the rest
Baby, I've been to the top I guess
With you I have been blessed
I won't take nothin less
I've been loved by the best...
WE GOT LOVE
You, You got me
We got somethin' everybody else can see
Me, I got you
We got a good thing honey you know we do
Friends, they all know
Âcause we can't help but let it show
Smiles, we can't hide
We got somethin' just too good to hold inside
CHORUS
We don't need no money, honey you and I
What we've got together, money just can't buy
What we've got, there's plenty of
I've got you, you've got me, we got love
INSTRUMENTAL
Time, Moves along
And honey we just keep on a keepin' on
Âcause love, makes us strong
As long as we've got love, We can't go wrong
CHORUS
Till the rivers all run dry
Till the sun falls from the sky
Till life on earth is through
I'll be needing you
I know sometimes you may wonder
From little things I say and do
But there's no need for you to wonder
If I need you, 'cause I'll need you
Till the rivers all run dry
Till the sun falls from the sky
Till life on earth is through
I'll be needing you
Too many times I don't tell you
Too many things get in the way
And even though sometimes I hurt you
Still you show me, in every way
Till the rivers all run dry
Till the sun falls from the sky
Till life on earth is through
I'll be needing you
I can see your heart is achin'
He hurt you more than he knew
But should you ever want to love again
I'll be faithful to you
You've been crying like a willow
When the night bird sings so blue
Trust was broken but hearts will heal
And I'll be faithful to you
In this world of pain and sorrow
Where a promise won't hold true
Here's a vow you can be sure of
I'll be faithful to you
--- Instrumental ---
So let me dry away your lonesome tears
Like the sun melts morning dew
And I will wrap you up in true, true love
And I'll be faithful to you
In this world of pain and sorrow
Where a promise won't hold true
Here's a vow you can be sure of
I'll be faithful to you
I'll be faithful to you...
I think about you
When I don't want to
Dream about your smiling face
I keep trying not to love you
But I love you anyway
We should be together, together
We should be walking side by side
We should be together, together
Keeping each other satisfied
I have thought to come to know you
I've come to need your company
What will I do if I can't have you
If I can't have you
What will I do
We should be together, together
We should be walking side by side
We should be together, together
Keeping each other satisfied
--- Instrumental ---
We should be together, together
We should be walking side by side
We should be together, together
Keeping each other satisfied...
I been a walkin', walkin' in the moonlight
Trippin' in the starlight, Lord, and I'm feelin' down
Walkin' in the shadows, sneakin' down a side road
Come early mornin' I'll be there on the edge of town
I was a thinkin', thinkin' bout a good thing
Thinkin' bout a sweet gleam, uum, in my honey's eyes
And I was a-sinkin', feelin' kinda lonesome
Come early morning I'll be home at my honey's side
I have drifted up across the mountain
And I have stumbled down the other side
And I've been tempted, tried and troubled
Come early morning I'll be home and satisfied

She give me little lovin'
Give me little sunshine
Make me have a good time, Lord
When I'm feelin' blue
I couldn't refuse her
Well I couldn't misuse her
Come early mornin' I'll be home
With my honeydew
I have drifted up across the mountains
I have stumbled down the other side
I've been tempted, tried and troubled
Come early mornin' I'll be home
And satisfied...
Pretty woman walking down the street
Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet
Pretty woman, I don't believe you, you're not the truth
No one could look as good as you
Mercy!

Pretty woman, won't you pardon me?
Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see
Pretty woman, that you look lovely as can be
Are you lonely just like me?

Pretty woman, stop a while
Pretty woman, talk a while
Pretty woman, give your smile to me
Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pretty woman, look my way
Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me
'Cause I need you, I'll treat you right
Come with me, baby, be mine tonight

Pretty woman, don't walk on by
Pretty woman, don't make me cry
Pretty woman, don't walk away, hey
Okay, if that's the way it must be, okay

I guess I'll go on home, it's late
There'll be tomorrow night
But wait! What do I see?
Is she walking back to me?
Yeah, she's walking back to me
Oh woah, pretty woman
A candy-colored clown they call the sandman
Tiptoes to my room every night
Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper
"Go to sleep. Everything is all right."
I close my eyes, then I drift away
Into the magic night, I softly say
A silent prayer like dreamers do
Then I fall asleep to dreams, my dreams of you
In dreams I walk with you, in dreams I talk to you
In dreams you're mine, all of the time
We're together in dreams, in dreams
But just before the dawn, I awake and find you gone
I can't help it, I can't help it, if I cry
I remember that you said goodbye
It's too bad that all these things
Can only happen in my dreams
Only in dreams, in beautiful dreams
Every time I look into your loving eyes
I see a love that money just can't buy
One look from you, I drift away
I pray that you are here to stay

Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it
Baby

Every time I hold you, I begin to understand
Everything about you tells me I'm your man
I live my life to be with you
No one can do the things you do

Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it
Baby
Anything you want
Anything you need
Anything at all
I'm glad to give my love to you
I know you feel the way I do

Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it
Baby
Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it
Baby

Anything at all
Baby
You got it
I was alright for awhile
I could smile for awhile
But I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say, "Hello"
Oh, you wished me well
You couldn't tell
That I'd been crying over you
Crying over you
When you said, "So long"
Left me standing all alone
Alone and crying, crying
Crying, crying
It's hard to understand
But the touch of your hand
Can start me crying
I thought that I was over you
But it's true, so true
I love you even more
Than I did before
But, darling, what can I do?
For you don't love me
And I'll always be crying over you
Crying over you
Yes, now you're gone
And from this moment on
I'll be crying, crying
Crying, crying
Yeah, crying, crying
Over you
I feel so bad I've got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind on Blue Bayou
Saving nickels, saving dimes
Working 'till the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou
I'm going back some day
Come what may to Blue Bayou
Where you sleep all day
And the catfish play on Blue Bayou
All those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be
Go to see my baby again
And to be with some of my friends
Maybe I'd be happy then on Blue Bayou
I'm going back some day
Gonna stay on Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou
Oh, that girl of mine by my side
The silver moon and the evening tide
Oh, some sweet day gonna take away
This hurtin' inside
I'll never be blue
My dreams come true on Blue Bayou
Dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah
Ooh-yay-yay-yay-yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-wah
Only the lonely
Only the lonely
Only the lonely (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)
Know the way I feel tonight (ooh-yay-yay-yay-yeah)
Only the lonely (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)
Know this feeling ain't right (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)
There goes my baby
There goes my heart
They're gone forever
So far apart
But only the lonely
Know why
I cry
Only the lonely
Dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah
Ooh-yay-yay-yay-yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-wah
Only the lonely
Only the lonely
Only the lonely (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)
Know the heartaches I've been through (ooh-yay-yay-yay-yeah)
Only the lonely (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)
Know I cry and cry for you (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)
Maybe tomorrow
A new romance
No more sorrow
But that's the chance
You gotta take
If your lonely heart breaks
Only the lonely
Dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah
I had to escape
The city was sticky and cruel
Maybe I should have called you first
But I was dying to get to you
I was dreaming while I drove the long straight road ahead, Uh-huh, yeah
Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
This fever for you was just burning me up inside

I drove all night to get to you
Is that all right?
I drove all night, crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep to make love to you
Is that all right?
I drove all night
What in this world
Keeps us from falling apart?
No matter where I go I hear
The beating of our one heart
I think about you when the night is cold and dark
Uh-huh, yeah
No one can move me the way that you do
Nothing erases this feeling between me and yoooooou
Ohhhhhhh
I drove all night to get to you
Is that all right?
I drove all night, crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep to make love to you
Is that all right?
I drove all niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight
Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
This fever for you was just burning me up
Insiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide
I drove all night to get to you (all night)
Is that all right?
I drove all night, crept in your room (all right)
Is that all right?
I drove all niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight
I drove all night to get to you (all night)
Is that all right?
I drove all night, crept in your room (all right)
Workin' all day
And the sun don't shine
Trying to get by
And I'm just killing time

I feel the rain
Fall the whole night through
Far away from you
California blue

California blue
Dreaming all alone
Nothing else to do
California blue

Everyday I pray
I'll be on my way
Saving love for you
California blue

One sunny day
I'll get back again
Somehow, someway
But I don't know when
California blue
California blue
Living my life
With you on my mind
Thinking of things
That I left far behind

It's been so long
Doing all I can do
To get back to you
California blue

California blue (California blue)
Dreaming all alone (California blue)
Nothing else to do (California blue)
California blue

Everyday I pray
I'll be on my way
Saving love for you
California blue

One sunny day
I'll get back again
Somehow, someway
But I don't know when
California blue
California blue
Still missing you
California blue
Still missing you
California blue
Still missing you
California blue
Just runnin' scared each place we go
So afraid that he might show
Yeah, runnin' scared, what would I do?
If he came back and wanted you
Just runnin' scared, feelin' low
Runnin' scared, you love him so
Just runnin' scared, afraid to lose
If he came back which one would you choose
Then all at once he was standing there
So sure of himself, his head in the air
My heart was breaking, which one would it be
You turned around and walked away with me
Darkness falls and she
Will take me by the hand
Take me to some twilight land
Where all but love is grey
Where I cant find my way
Without her as my guide

Night falls, Im cast beneath her spell
Daylight comes, our heaven turns to hell
Am I left to burn
And burn eternally?
Shes a mystery to me

Shes a mystery girl
Shes a mystery girl

In the night of love
Words tangled in her hair
Words soon to disappear
A love so sharp it cut
Like a switchblade to my heart
Words tearing me apart
She tears again my bleeding heart
I wanna run, shes pulling me apart
Fallen angel cries
And I just melt away
Shes a mystery to me

Shes a mystery girl
Shes a mystery girl
Shes a mystery girl
Shes a mystery girl

Haunted by her side
Its the darkness in her eyes
That so enslaves me
But if my love is blind
Then I dont want to see
Shes a mystery to me

Night falls, Im cast beneath her spell
Daylight comes, our heaven turns to hell
Am I left to burn
And burn eternally?
Shes a mystery to me
Shes a mystery girl
Shes a mystery girl
Shes a mystery girl
Shes a mystery girl

Shes a mystery girl
Shes a mystery girl
Shes a mystery girl

Shes a mystery girl
Shes a mystery girl
Shes a mystery girl
Your baby doesn't love you anymore
Golden days before they end
Whisper secrets to the wind
Your baby won't be near you any more
Tender nights before they fly
Send falling stars that seem to cry
Your baby doesn't want you anymore
It's over
It breaks your heart in two, To know she's been untrue
But oh what will you do? Then she said to you
There's someone new We're through We're through
It's over It's over It's over
All the rainbows in the sky
Start to weep, then say goodbye
You won't be seeing rainbows any more
Setting suns before they fall, Echo to you that's all that's all
But you'll see lonely sunset after all
It's over It's over It's over It's over
Listen all you people
Try and understand
You may be a soldier
Woman, child or man

But there won't be many coming home
No, there won't be many coming home
Oh, there won't be many
Maybe ten out of twenty
But there won't be many coming home

Now the old folks will remember
On that dark and dismal day
How their hearts were choked with pride
As their children marched away
Now the glory is all gone
They are left alone

And there won't be many coming home
No, there won't be many coming home
Oh, there won't be many
Maybe five out of twenty
But there won't be many coming home
Look real closely at the soldier
Coming at you through the haze
He may be the younger brother who ran away
And before you kill another
Listen to what I say

Oh, there won't be many coming home
Oh, there won't be many coming home
Oh, there won't be many
There may not be any
But there won't be many coming home

If they all came back but one
He was still some mother's son
And there won't be many coming home

Oh, there won't be many coming home
Oh, there won't be many coming home
Oh, there won't be many coming home...
Where the Nile flows
And the moon glows
On the silent sand
Of an ancient land
When a dream dies
And a heart cries
Shahdaroba
Is the word they whisper alone
Shahdaroba, Shahdaroba
Means the future is much better than the past
Shahdaroba, Shahdaroba
In the future you will find a love that lasts
So when tears flow
And you don't know
What on earth to do
And your world is blue
When your dream dies
And your heart cries
Shahdaroba
Fate knows what's best for you
Shahdaroba, Shahdaroba
Face the future and forget about the past
Shahdaroba, Shahdaroba
In the future you will find a love that lasts
Shahdaroba
Dream, when you're feeling blue
Dream, that's the thing to do
Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
You'll find your share of memories there
So dream, when the day is through
Dream, and they might come true
Things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream dream
Dream, when the day is through
Dream, and they might come true
Things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream dream
In dreams we do so many things
We set aside the rules we know
And fly the world so high
In great and shining rings
If only we could always live in dreams
If only we could make of life
What, in dreams, it seems
But in the real world
We must say real goodbyes
No matter if the love will live
It will never die
In the real world
There are things that we can't change
And endings come to us
In ways that we can't rearrange
I love you, and you love me
But sometimes we must let it be
In the real world
In the real world
When we were dreaming heart to heart
I wish that we had stayed right there
For when the dreamers do awake
The dreams do disappear
If only we could always live in dreams
If only we could make of life
What, in dreams, it seems
But in the real world
We must say real goodbyes
No matter if the love will live
It will never die
In the real world
There are things that we can't change
And endings come to us
In ways that we can't rearrange
I love you, and you love me
But sometimes we must let it be
In the real world
In the real world
Sha la la, dooby wah
Dum dum dum, yeh yeh, um

Dum dum dum, yeh yeh um
Oh blue angel, don't you cry
Just because he said goodbye
Oh, ahh ahh ahh
No don't cry
Oh blue angel, have no fear
Brush away lonely teardrops
Hey hey, whoa whoa
Well love's precious flame can just burn in vain
But you're not to blame
You thought love was a game and it's oh such a shame
But don't you cry, don't sigh, I'll tell you why
I'll never say goodbye blue angel
Sha la la, dooby wah
Dum dum dum, yeh yeh, um
Wah wah wah wah
Dum dum dum dum dum dum
We'll have lovin' so fine
Magic moments divine
If you'll just say you're mine
I'll love you till the end of time
Don't you worry your pretty head
I'll never let you down
I'll always be around
Blue angel
Sha la la, dooby wah
Dum dum dum, yeh yeh, um
Blue angel
Sha la la
I sat there alone upon the ferris wheel
A pastel colored carriage in the air
I thought you'd leave me dangling for a little while
A silly twist upon a childish dare
Below I saw you whispering to another man
Who held the lever that could bring me down
He'd stop the world from turning at your command
It's always something cruel that laughter drowns
And I'm up while the dawn is breaking
Even though my heart is aching
I should be drinking a toast
To absent friends
Instead of these comedians
I can hardly hear the music from the carousel
The wind picks up, the carriage starts sway
As one by one the lights go out
It's closing time
I see you take his hand and walk away walk away
They say that you will always be the last to know
They say that all that glitters is not gold
It's not just that you're never coming back to me
It's the bitter way that I was told
And I'm up while the dawn is breaking
Even though my heart is aching
I should be drinking a toast
To absent friends
Instead of these comedians
Hey, Leah Leah
Hey, Leah Leah
Here I go
From the hut to the boat to the sea for Leah
Uh huh! I gotta go diving in the bay
Gotta get a lot of oysters
Find some pearls today
To make a pretty necklace for Leah
Leah
I gotta go deep and find the ones just right
I'll bet my Leah will be surprised tonight
I'll place the pearls around the only girl for me
Leah
But something's wrong
I cannot move around
My leg is caught
It's pulling me down
But I'll keep my hands shut tight for if they find me
They'll find the pearl for Leah
And now it's over
I'm awake at last
Oh, heartaches and memories from the past
It was just another dream about my lost love
About Leah
Hey, Leah Leah
Hey, Leah Leah
Here I go
Back to sleep and in my dreams
I'll be with Leah
Leah
Leah
Love hurts, love scars
Love wounds and mars
Any heart not tough
Nor strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud, holds a lot of rain
Love hurts
Love hurts
I'm young, I know
But even so
I know a thing or two
I learned from you
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a stove, burns you when it's hot
Love hurts
Love hurts
Some fools rave of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves, I guess
But they're not foolin' me
I know it isn't true, know it isn't true
Love is just a lie made to make you blue
Love hurts
Love hurts
Love hurts
...
The summer sun looked down
On our love long ago
But in my heart I feel
The same old afterglow
A love so beautiful
In every way
A love so beautiful
We let it slip away
We were too young to understand
To ever know
That lovers drift apart
And that's the way love goes
A love so beautiful
A love so sweet
A love so beautiful
A love for you and me
And I when I think of you
I fall in love again
A love so beautiful
In every way
A love so beautiful
We let it slip away
A love so beautiful
In every way
A love so beautiful
We let it slip away
Sweet dream baby
Sweet dream baby
Sweet dream baby
How long must I dream?
Dream baby got me dreaming sweet dreams, the whole day through
Dream baby got me dreaming sweet dreams, the night-time too
I love you and I'm dreaming of you, that won't do
Dream baby, make me stop my dreaming, you can make my dreams come true
Sweet dream baby
Sweet dream baby
Sweet dream baby
How long must I dream?
Dream baby got me dreaming sweet dreams, the whole day through
Dream baby got me dreaming sweet dreams, the night-time too
I love you and I'm dreaming of you, that won't do
Dream baby, make me stop my dreaming, you can make my dreams come true
Oh sweet dream baby
Yeah sweet dream baby
Sweet dream baby
How long must I dream?
Sweet dream baby
Sweet dream baby
Sweet dream baby
(The pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue)
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
Pretty pencils to write I love you
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Crowded street, busy feet, hustle by him
Downtown shoppers, Christmas is nigh
There he sits all alone on the sidewalk (aaaaaaaah)
Hoping that you won't pass him by (oooo ooo ooh)
Should you stop? Better not, much too busy
You're in a hurry, my how time does fly
In the distance the ringing of laughter (oooh oooh oooh)
And in the midst of the laughter he cries
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
Pretty pencils to write I love you
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue (oooh oooh)
Whenever I chance to meet
Some old friends on the street
They wonder how does a man get to be this way
I've always got a smiling face
Anytime and any place
And everytime they ask me why
I just smile and say
You've got to
Kiss an angel good morning
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good morning
And love her like the devil when you get back home
Well people may try to guess
The secret of a happiness
But some of them never learn it's a simple thing
The secret i'm speaking of
Is a woman and a man in love
And the answer is in this song
That i always sing
You've got to
Kiss an angel good morning
And let you know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good morning
And love her like the devil when you get back home
Kiss an angel good morning
And let you know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good morning
And love her like the devil when you get back home
Before you take another step, there's something you should know
About the years ahead and how they'll be
You'll be living in a world where roses hardly ever grow
'Cause all I have to offer you is me

There'll be no mansion waiting on the hill with crystal chandeliers
And there'll be no fancy clothes for you to wear
Everything I have is standing here in front of you to see
All I have to offer you is me

Sweetheart I'll give you all my love in every way I can
But make sure that's what you want while you're still free
The only gold I have for you is in this wedding band
'Cause all I have to offer you is me
Take time out for Jesus He took time for you!
Take a little time in the mornin
And You'll feel better all day
Take a little time for Jesus
To get down on your knees and prey
He took the time to die on the cross
So all the soles couldn't be lost
If you find your self slippin and the pain to do
Take time out for Jesus He took time for you
Sometimes you may be in a hurry
You have so many things to do
So don't forget about jesus
Remember he didn't forget you
He took the time to die on the cross
So all the soles couldn't be lost
If you find your self slippin and the pain to do
Take time out for Jesus He took time for you
Take time out for Jesus He took time for you!
Lord, Build Me A Cabin In Glory
Many years I've been looking for a place to call home
But I've failed here to find it, so I must travel on;
I don't care for fine mansions on earth's sinking sand
Lord, build me a cabin in the corner of glory land

Yes, build me just a cabin in the corner of glory land
In the shade of the tree of life that it may ever stand;
Where I can just hear the angels sing, and shake Jesus' hand
Lord, build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland
Blessed Lord, I'm not asking to live in the midst
For I know I'm not worthy of such splendor as this
But I'm asking for mercy while humbly I stand
Lord, build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland

I have many dear loved ones who have gone on this way
On that great final morning, shall I hear them all say
Come and join in our singing and play in our band?
Lord, build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland

I don't know why I love you but I do
I don't know why I cry so but I do
I only know I'm lonely and that I want you only
I don't know why I love you but I do
I can't sleep nights because I feel so restless
I don't know what to do, I feel so helpless
And since you've went away, I cry both night and day
I don't know why I love you but I do
My days have been so lonely
My nights have been so blue
I don't know how I spend it, but I do
Each night I sit alone and tell myself
That I will fall in love with someone else
I guess I'm wasting time but I've got to clear my mind
I don't know why I love you but I do
My days have been so lonely
My nights have been so blue
I don't know how I spend it, but I do
Each night I sit alone and tell myself
That I will fall in love with someone else
I guess I'm wasting time but I've got to clear my mind
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you but I do
I do
Oh the crystal chandeliers light up the paintings on your wall
The marble statuettes are standing stately in the hall
But will the timely crowd that has you laughing loud help you dry your tears
When the new wears off of your crystal chandeliers
I never did fit in too well with the folks you knew
And it's plain to see that the likes of me don't fit with you
So you traded me for the gaiety of the well to do
And you turned away from the love I offered you
Oh the crystal chandeliers...
I see your picture in the news most every day
You're the chosen girl of the social world so the stories say
But a paper smile only lasts a while then it fades away
And the love we knew will come home to you some day
Oh the crystal chandeliers...
When the new wears off of your crystal chandeliers
Oh the snakes crawl at night, that's what they say
When the sun goes down, then the snakes will play
I watched that car pull right up into my driveway
Saw a shadow slip away from my house
So I hurried straight and looked in her room
And I found out that it was my loving spouse
Oh, the snakes crawl at night, that's what they say
So I waited in the shadows until morning
And the gun I held was trembling in my hand
No, I did not plan to give them any warning
Cause the devil on my shoulder had command
Oh, the snakes crawl at night, that's what they say
When the sun goes down, then the snakes will play
Oh the trial in a little while was over
And they sentenced me to die right away
But before I leave this courtroom please, Your Honor
There's something more that I would like to say
All the snakes crawl at night, that's what they say
When the sun goes down, then the snakes will play
Time has passed and things have changed
You've gone your way I've gone mine
On the surface it's all over but beneath the surface
You're still on my mind
'Cause you're still the only one I'll ever love
Forget the hours, forget the miles
Your lips are still the lips I'm dreaming of
And you're still the only one I'll ever love
--- Instrumental ---
All my thoughts of you are good ones
Happy hours that just flew by
You were always someone special
And you'll be my someone special till I die
'Cause you're still the only one I'll ever love
Treasured mem'ry of treasured time
Your lips are still the lips I'm dreaming of
And you're still the only one I'll ever love
Yes you're still the only one I'll ever love
Treasured mem'ry of treasured time
Your lips are still the lips I'm dreaming of
And you're still the only one I'll ever love
Sometimes I want to throw my arms around you
Then I tremble at the thought of giving in
Because I know how much it cost to love you
And I'm so afraid of losing you again

Being close to you revives the sorrow
That wakes me up and tells me I can't win
I'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow
But I'm so afraid of losing you again

If heaven were to hear my heart's confession
Wanting you would be my greatest sin
But I'm glad that you're no longer my possession
'Cause I'm so afraid of losing you again

Being close to you revives the sorrow
That wakes me up and tells me I can't win
I'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow
But I'm so afraid of losing you again
But I'm so afraid of losing you again
Down at the railroad station there's people gettin' on
Some are a goin' north some are a goin' south I'm just goin' to be gone
Some people are born to be takers others just wanna give
Some people live just to love but I just love to live
For I was just born to be exactly what you see
Nothing more or less I'm not the worst or the best
I just try to be exactly what you see today and every day I'm just me
When people say their life is rough I wonder compared to what
Some are wantin' more and more's gettin' less I just want what I've got
Some wanna live on a hill others down by the sea
Some wanna live inside high walls I just wanna live free
For I was just born...
Oh I was just born to be exactly what you see today and every day I'm just me
I was lost but Jesus saved me
He gave his life on Calvary's tree
And though I failed him
He still loves me
Through his grace I've been set free
I know I don't deserve a mansion
'Cause I was born a sinful man
No, I don't deserve a mansion
But Jesus built a home for me in glory land
It was our sin that he died for
For all mankind he paid the price
Who are we that he should love us
Enough to give his life
I know I don't deserve a mansion
'Cause I was born a sinful man
No, I don't deserve a mansion
But Jesus built a home for me in glory land
I wanna share your life
Every minute
Every day and night
And I just want you to know
That whatever you do and wherever you go
Remember someone loves you, honey
No matter what
Just be my girl
Someone loves you, honey
More than anything in the world
I'm so glad that I'm the one
That you come to when you need someone
That's what my love is for
It's a shoulder to lean on a port in the storm
Remember someone loves you, honey
No matter what
I just want you to be my girl
Someone loves you, honey
More than anything in the world
Rain dripping off the brim of my hat
It sure is cold today
And here I am'a walking down sixty-six
Wish she hadn't done me that way
Sleeping under a table at a road side park
A man could wake up dead
But it sure seems warmer than it did
Sleepin in our king size bed
Is anybody goin to San Antone
Or Pheonix Arizona
Anyplace is alright as long as I
Can forget I've ever known her
Wind whipping down the neck of my shirt
Like I ain't got nothing on
But I'd rather fight the wind and rain
Than what I've been fighting at home
Yonder comes a truck with the US mail
People writing letters back home
Tomorrow she'll probably want me back
But I'll still be just as gone
Is anybody goin to San Antone
Or Pheonix Arizona
Anyplace is alright as long as I
Can forget I've ever known her
Anyplace is alright as long as I
Forget I've ever known her
There was a man more than a man
Called Jesus Christ of Galilee
There was a place where Jesus prayed
A place thats called Gethsemane
There on a hill called Calvary
There stood a cross of agony
Nailed to that cross where I should be
He took my place at Calvary
Now I'm a child of royalty
And even angels envy me
My Jesus cared so much for me
He took my place at Calvary
Christ Jesus lives He lives today
From sin and debt He set me free
Now hand in hand each place I go
My Jesus Christ He walks with me
And when I ask how could it be
That Jesus cared so much for me
The answer comes so tenderly
He took my place at Calvary
Now I'm a child of royalty
And even angels envy me
My Jesus cared so much for me
He took my place at Calvary
And now my Lord the son of God
I share with everyone I see
I give my best my all to Him
Because He gives so much to me
Now if His own youll wanna be
Come join His royal family
Let your heart sing joyfully
He took my place at Calvary
Now I'm a child of royalty
And even angels envy me
My Jesus cared so much for me
He took my place at Calvary
Blind man can't see flowers growing in the garden
Crippled man can't walk places where he wants to go
Man that can't talk things he will never say
And a man that can't hear words he will never know
So if you can see and if you can walk
If you can hear and if you can talk
Then be grateful be grateful for what you've got
Cause for some folks these things would mean a lot
I once heard a man say all he wanted out of life was money
To be the richest man have wealth and fame untold
But he could see he could walk he could hear and he could talk
And for some folks this would mean much more than gold
So if you can see and if you can walk
If you can hear and if you can talk
Then be grateful be grateful for what you've got
Cause for some folks these things would mean a lot
So if you can see and if you can walk
If you can hear and if you can talk
Then be grateful be grateful for what you've got
Cause for some folks these things would mean a lot
Cause for some folks these things would mean a lot
I remember walking with my daddy through his weathered fields of grain
But he wouldn't curse the sun or give up on the rain
I ask him why don't you sell this place
Move to town you'll have money to burn
He said son you don't understand I don't do this for what I earn
Oh it's just for the love of it that's all the reason you need
What more could anyone ask  satisfaction  guaranteed
Don't chase rainbows or your pot of gold you'll always have enough
If you'll do everything you do  just for the love
Drove on back to Nashville thinking
That my daddy's words couldn't be true
How could a man keep pouring out his heart just to get it broke into
Then I looked around my two bare rooms and realized he wasn't wrong
And picked up this old guitar and poured out another song
Oh it's just for the love of it that's all the reason you need
What more could anyone ask  satisfaction  guaranteed
Don't chase rainbows or your pot of gold you'll always have enough
If you'll do everything you do  just for the love
The next summer I walked with my daddy
Through his golden fields of grain
Giving thanks to heaven above for the sunshine and the rain
Just leave it in the good Lords hands He always will provide
And you'll know what His reason is you don't even have ask Him why
He'll say just for the love of it that's all the reason you need
What more could anyone ask  satisfaction  guaranteed
Don't chase rainbows or your pot of gold you'll always have enough
If you'll do everything you do  just for the love
Don't chase rainbows or your pot of gold you'll always have enough
If you'll do everything you do  just for the love
Jesus I know I neglected to do
The little things the big things you wanted me to
I've let you down Jesus that's not hard to see
Jesus oh Jesus don't give up on me
Stand by me Jesus forgive me somehow
If there's any hope left don't leave me now
I might be worth savin' I'm trying to be
Jesus oh Jesus don't give up on me
It's late I know and I made you wait
But don't turn the light out don't lock the gate
Forgiveness and patience that's all I need
Jesus oh Jesus don't give up on me
Stand by me Jesus forgive me somehow...
So I feel so blue sometimes I wanna die
And so I've got a broken heart so what
They say that time will heal all wounds in mice and men
And I know that someday I'll forget and love again

But just between you and me I've got my doubts about it
'Cause just between you and me you're too much to forget

So I lost the only girl I ever loved
And so I've never felt so low so what
I'll just tell myself each time I wanna cry
That someday time will dry the teardrops from my eyes

But just between you and me, I'm not so sure about it
'Cause just between you and me, you're too much to forget
You're too much to forget
There's a church in the valley by the wildwood
No lovelier place in the dale
No place is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the dale
How sweet, on a clear Sabbath morning
To listen to the clear ringing bells
Its tones, so sweetly, are calling
Oh, come to the church in the vale
Oh, come, come, come, come
Come to the church in the wildwood
Oh, come to the church in the dale
No spot is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the vale
There, close by the church in the valley
Lies one that I loved so well
She sleeps, sweetly sleeps, 'neath the willow
Disturb not her rest in the vale
There, close by the side of that loved one
'Neath the trees where the wild flowers bloom
When the farewell hymns shall be chanted
I shall rest by her side in the tomb
Oh, come, come, come, come
Come to the church in the wildwood
Oh, come to the church in the dale
No spot is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the vale
Does my ring hurt your finger
When you go out at night?
When I bought if for you darling
It seemed to fit just right
Should I take it to the jeweler
So it won't fit so tight?
Does my ring hurt your finger
When you go out at night?
Did you enjoy yourself last night dear
How was the show?
You know I don't mind it
When you go
I understand we all need time alone
But why do you always leave your ring at home?
Does my ring hurt your finger
When you're away from me?
I'm so proud when you wear it
For all the world to see
Should I take it to the jeweler
So it won't fit so tight?
Does my ring hurt your finger
When you go out at night?
Does my ting hurt your finger
When you go out at night?
Father give me strength, to do what I must do
Father give me courage, to say what I must say
Let thy spirit move me, I'm nothing on my own
Father stand by me, I cannot stand alone
In Jesus' Name I pray
Father open up my eyes to your wonders all around
Father let me see the good & beauty of this day
Fill my heart with love for my fellow man
And if I'm tempted Father
Father stay my hand
In Jesus' name I pray
Father help me through the troubled days that lie ahead
Let your light shine before me, that I may find the way
Don't let me stumble Father, or fall beneath my load
Father guide my footsteps, hold me to the road
In Jesus' Name I Pray
Let not hunger be my guide, nor fear be my master
Father let not envy be a part of me in any way
Father search my soul, take away my fear & doubt
Any smallness that you find there, Father cast it out
In Jesus' Name I pray
We're just a little grain of sand in His hand
We're just a little grain of sand in His hand
And the four winds blow just to let us know:
He's the man
He's the maker, the giver and the taker
He's everything we see or say or do
He's the ultimate conception within the Master plan
He's the man
We're just a little bit of wisdom in His mind
We're just a little bit of wisdom in His mind
And the more we learn, the more we understand:
He's the man
He's the maker, the giver and the taker
He's everything we see or say or do
He's the ultimate conception within the Master plan
He's the man
We're just a little bit of pity in His heart
We're just a little bit of pity in His heart
But to Him we belong, be us right or be us wrong:
He's the man
He's the maker, the giver and the taker
He's everything we see or say or do
He's the ultimate conception within the Master plan
He's the man
He's the man. (He's the man.)
As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
Do know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always
As today I know I'm living but tomorrow
Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
Cause I'll be loving you always

Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4 (Always)
Until the day that is the day that are no more
(Did you know that you're loved by somebody?)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Always)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (I'll be loving you forever)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Always)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Always)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)

We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your life times that and twice its double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it but not of it
You're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell
Change your words into truths and then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great-great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Loving you)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Loving you)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Loving you)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (Be loving you)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Loving you)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Loving you)
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4 (Loving you)
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Loving you)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Be loving you)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (Loving you)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Loving you)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Now ain't that loving you?)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Ain't that loving you?)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (And I've got to say always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream-Um (Always)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Always)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you
Very superstitious
Writing's on the wall
Very superstitious
Ladder's about to fall
Thirteen month old baby
Broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck
The good things in your past

Superstition ain't the way

Very superstitious
Wash your face and hands
Rid me of the problem
Do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream
Keep me going strong
You don't want to save me
Sad is my song
When you believe in things
That you don't understand

Superstition ain't the way

Isn't she lovely?
Isn't she wonderful?
Isn't she precious?
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely made from love?

Isn't she pretty?
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us he's given life to one
But isn't she lovely made from love?


Isn't she lovely?
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie, it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one
That's so very lovely made from love
No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of Spring, no song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday, within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

Of my heart
Of my heart
Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people

Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people


You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
I can feel it all, all, all-all-all over people

Can't you feel it all over?
Come on, let's feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
Everybody, all over people
Looking back on when I
Was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing
We were happy with the
Joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine, ooh
Greeted at the back door
With, "Boy, thought I told you not to go outside"
Trying your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whooping your behind

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
'Cause I love them so

Brother says he's telling
About you playing doctor with that girl
Just don't tell and I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smoking cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall
(You nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing isn't right
But while you were doing it, it sure felt outta sight
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
Eee eee!
Watch this y'all
Comprende señora
See here mama, you understand uh (mm-ah)
Well huh like huh I understand how you can't
I've been to Paris, Beirut you know Iraq, Iran, "Ukraingia" you know
I speak very very um fluent Spanish
Todo 'stá bien chévere' you understand that ? chévere
Yes I mama, I got my shakers

Everybody's got a thing
But some don't know how to handle it
Always reaching out in vain
Just taking the things not worth having but

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out

They say your style of life's a drag
And that you must go other places
But just don't you feel too bad
When you get fooled by smiling faces
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out
When you get off your trip

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standing in the side
When you check it out
When you get off your trip

Everybody needs a change
A chance to check out the new
But you're the only one to see
The changes you take yourself through

But don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, pretty mama
'Cause I'll be standing in the wings
When you check it out

Don't you worry 'bout a thing

A boy is born in hard time Mississippi
Surrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty
His parents give him love and affection
To keep him strong moving in the right direction
Living just enough, just enough for the city

His father works some days for fourteen hours
And you can bet he barely makes a dollar
His mother goes to scrub the floors for many
And you'd best believe she hardly gets a penny
Living just enough, just enough for the city (yeah)

His sister's black but she is sho 'nuff pretty
Her skirt is short but Lord her legs are sturdy
To walk to school she's got to get up early
Her clothes are old but never are they dirty
Living just enough, just enough for the city (um-hum)

Her brother's smart he's got more sense than many
His patience's long but soon he won't have any
To find a job is like a haystack needle
Because where he lives they don't use colored people
Living just enough, just enough for the city
(Living just enough for the city)
Living for the city, yeah
(Believing just enough for the city)
Ain't nothing but a city
(Believing just enough for the city)
Living for the city, yeah yeah
(Believing just enough for the city)
Nothing but a city
(Believing just enough for the city)
Live for the city, yeah yeah
(Believing just enough for the city)
The fucking crud is shitty
(Believing just enough for the city)
Live for the city
(Believing just enough for the city)
Ain't nothing but a city, woo
(Believing just enough for the city)
Everybody clap their hands together now, woo
(Believing just enough for the city)
Hmm, for the city yeah
(Believing just enough for the city)
For the city, yeah yeah
(Believing just enough for the city)
For the city, yeah
(Believing just enough for the city)
Bus for New York City!
Hey, bus driver! I'm getting on that, hold it
Thanks a lot
Wow, New York, just like I pictured it
Skyscrapers and everything
Hey hey brother, hey come here slick
Hey you look, you look hip man
Hey you wanna make yourself five bucks man
You look hip
Run this across the street for me right quick
Okay, run this across the street for me
What? Huh? I didn't know! What?
Gimme your hands up you punk!
I'm just going across the street
Put that leg up, shut your mouth
Hell no, what did I do?
Okay, turn around, turn around
Put your hands behind your back, let's go, let's go
A jury of your peers having found you guilty, ten years
What?
Come on, come on, get in that cell nigga
God, lord

His hair is long, his feet are hard and gritty
He spends his life walking the streets of New York City
He's almost dead from breathing in air pollution
He tried and fought but to him there's no solution
Living just enough, just enough for the city
I hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow
And that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow
This place is cruel nowhere could be much colder
If we don't change, the world will soon be over
Living just enough, stop giving just enough for the city
People keep on learning
Soldiers keep on warring
World keep on turning
'Cause it won't be too long

Powers keep on lying
While your people keep on dying
World keep on turning
'Cause it won't be too long

I'm so darn glad he let me try it again
Because my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Going to keep on trying
'Til I reach my highest ground

Teachers keep on teaching
Preachers keep on preaching
World keep on turning
'Cause it won't be too long
Oh no
Lovers keep on loving
Believers keep on believing
Sleepers just stop sleeping
'Cause it won't be too long
Oh no

I'm so glad that he let me try it again
'Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Going to keep on trying
'Til I reach my highest ground
Woo

'Til I reach my highest ground
No one's going to bring me down
Oh no
'Til I reach my highest ground
Don't you let nobody bring you down (They'll sho 'nuff try)
God is gonna show you highest ground
He's the only friend you'll have around
'Cause the rest of the world will bring you down
You know it doesn't make much sense
There ought to be a law against
Anyone who takes offense
At a day in your celebration
'Cause we all know in our minds
That there ought to be a time
That we can set aside
To show just how much we love you
And I'm sure you would agree
It couldn't fit more perfectly
Than to have a world party on the day you came to be

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

I just never understood
How a man who died for good
Could not have a day that would
Be set aside for his recognition
Because it should never be
Just because some cannot see
The dream as clear as he
That they should make it become an illusion
And we all know everything
That he stood for time will bring
For in peace our hearts will sing
Thanks to Martin Luther King
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

Why has there never been a holiday
Where peace is celebrated
All throughout the world

The time is overdue
For people like me and you
Who know the way to truth
Is love and unity to all God's children
It should be a great event
And the whole day should be spent
In full remembrance
Of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people
So let us all begin
We know that love can win
Let it out, don't hold it in
Sing it loud as you can
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Ooh yeah
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday...

We know the key to unity of all people
Is in the dream that you had so long ago
That lives in all of the hearts of people
That believe in unity
We'll make the dream become a reality
I know we will
Because our hearts tell us so
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
You would be jamming and jamming and jamming, jam on

They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
Because we've only just begun
Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
You would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I know nobody told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the the break of dawn
We're jammin', jammin', jammin' jam on

You ask me am I happy
Well as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
Because we all just made a pact
We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star

You didn't know that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Don't you stop the music, oh no
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Na, na na...
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Nobody told you Oh, Oh, Oh, you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you if someone approached you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Yesterday to tell you that you would be jammin' you would not believe it because you never thought that you would be jammin'
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Jammin' 'til the break of dawn
Oh, Oh, Oh, You may as well believe what you are feeling
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Because you feel your body jammin'
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Oh, Oh, you would be jammin' until the break of dawn
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Oh so long for this night I prayed
That a star would guide you my way
To share with me this special day
Where a ribbon's in the sky for our love
If allowed may I touch your hand
And if pleased may I once again
So that you too will understand
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love

Do...Do
Do Do Do Do Do
HMM HMM

This is not a coincidence
And far more than a lucky chance
But what is that was always meant
Is our ribbon in the sky for our love, love
We can't lose with God on our side
We'll find strength in each tear we cry
From now on it will be you and I
And our ribbon in the sky
Ribbon in the sky
A ribbon in the sky for our love
Do...Do
Do Do Do Do Do
HMM HMM

There's a ribbon in the sky for our love
You made my soul a burning fire
You're getting to be my one desire
You're getting to be all that matters to me
And let me tell you girl
I hope and pray each day I live
A little more love I'll have to give
A little more love that's devoted and true
Cause all I do is think about you

All I do, is think about you (thinking about you, baby)
All I do, is think about you

Baby just suppose I should happen to cross your mind
And by some chance a boy like me you're really been trying to find
Well let me tell you girl
Think of how exciting it would be
If you should discover you feel like me
If you should discover this dream is for two
We'll I'm gonna tell you girl
I'd light a candle every day
And pray that you'll always feel this way
And pray that our love will forever be new
Cause all I do is think about you
All I do, is think about you (I think about you)
All I do, is think about you

Gonna tell you girl
I'd light a candle every day
And pray that you'll always feel this way
And pray that our love will forever be new
I'm gonna tell you girl
If I cannot have you for my own
I'd rather be lonely and all alone
I'd rather keep thinking the way that I do
Cause all I do is think about you

All I do, is think about you
All I do, is think about you
(Think about you baby)
All I do, is think about you
(Think about you baby)
All I do, is think about you
(All I do, is think about you baby)
All I do, is think about you
(Think about you baby)
All I do, is think about you
(Baby, baby)
I'm thinking baby, 'bout you baby
I'm thinking baby, 'bout you baby
I'm thinking baby, 'give it to me baby
I'm thinking baby, 'bout you baby

All I do, is think about you
All I do, is think about you
(Think about you baby)

All I do, is think about you
Can't you feel the fire burning?
Can't you feel the birds humming? (All I do, is think about you)
Can't you feel my love flowing? (All I do, is think about you)
Can't you see my love growing?
All I do, is think about you
Over time, I've been building my castle of love
Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away
Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect come true
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say come back some other day

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me now to find
The love that I've sought can never be mine

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me
And though the odds say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find
You too like I
Overjoyed, over loved, over you
Over you
See the girl with the diamonds in her shoes? Yeah
She walks around like she's got nothin' to lose
Yeah, she's a go-getter, she's everybody's type
She's a queen of the city but she don't believe the hype
She's got her own elevation, holy motivation
So I wrote some letters out in big bold type

I got faith in you, baby
I got faith in you now
And you've been such a, such a good friend to me
Know that I love you somehow
I met you, hallelujah, I got faith

He's a go-getter, he's everybody's type
I'mma make it my mission, make him feel alright
He's a twelve on a ten point, rockin' out to his joint
Just say the word 'cause I could sing all night

I got faith in you, baby
I got faith in you now
And you've been such a, such a good friend to me
Know that I love you somehow
I met you, hallelujah, I got faith
Faith

My cherie amour, lovely as a summer day
My cherie amour, distant as the milky way
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you, but you never noticed me
My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine

La la la la la la
La la la la la la

Maybe someday, you'll see my face among the crowd
Maybe someday, I'll share your little distant cloud
Oh, cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
Call up, ring once, hang up the phone
To let me know you made it home
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover
If she's with me, I'll blink the lights
To let you know tonight's the night
For me and you, my part-time lover

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

If I'm with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by, don't even speak
Know the word's "discreet" with part-time lovers
But if there's some emergency
Have a male friend to ask for me
So then she won't peek it's really you my part-time lover

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right
Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-pa-da-da-da
(Part-time lovers)
De-hee, da-pa-da-da-da-da, dadadadadadada, pa-da-da-da, pa-pa-da-pa-pa-pa-pa-da-da-da
(Part-time lovers)

We are undercover passion on the run, yeah
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

I've got something that I must tell
Last night someone rang our doorbell
And it was not you, my part-time lover
And then a man called our exchange
But didn't want to leave his name
I guess that two can play the game
Of part-time lovers
You and me, part-time lovers
But, she and he, part-time lovers

Just give the world love
When I see you on the street
My whole body gets weak
When you're standing in a crowd
Your love talks to me so loud

Girl, do I do
What you do
When I do my love to you?

When I hear you on the phone
Your sweet, sexy voice turns my ear all the way on
Just the mention of your name
Seems to drive my head insane

When I do my love to you?
Baby

Just imagine how it's going to feel when we hug and kiss

But we're just going to play and play until it goes away
So, if you dont like the groove you can turn the record off
It won't cost you nothing but a penny and you'll have a cough
I know I cannot rhyme cause I ain't like a friend of mine
But I ha ha ha ha h-ha ha ha
Now everybody's talking about the jive is in
Well, I know I've got something for your body
Cause I

For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Someone I've needed so long
For once, unafraid, I can go where life leads me
And somehow I know I'll be strong
For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Oh, someone warm like you
Would make my dreams come true
For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before
For once, I have something I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore
For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love, I can make it
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me
Someone who needs me
Hey, hey, hey, hey yeah
Oh, I'm in love, baby

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before
For once, I have something I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore
For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love, I can make it
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me
Someone who needs me
For once in my life
Somebody that needs me
For once in my life
I see us in the park
Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
And words from our hearts
Told only to the wind felt even without being said
I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's sumptin' about your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet

There's sumptin' about your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
Knocks me off my feet

I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
More and more

We lay beneath the stars
Under a lovers tree that's seen through the eyes of my mind
I reach out for the part
Of me that lives in you that only our two hearts can find
But I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's sumptin' about your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
There's sumptin' about your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
Knocks me off my feet

I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
Darling I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
Darling I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been wasting most of their time
Glorifying days long gone behind
They've been wasting most their days
In remembrance of ignorance oldest praise

Tell me who of them will come to be?
How many of them are you and me?

Dissipation of race relations
Consolation
Segregation

Confirmation to the evils of the world
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
They've been looking in their minds
For the day that sorrow's lost from time
They keep telling of the day
When the Savior of love will come to stay

Tell me who of them will come to be?
How many of them are you and me?

Proclamation of race relations

They've been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
We've been spending too much of our lives
Living in a pastime paradise
Let's start living our lives
Living for the future paradise
Praise to our lives
Living for the future paradise
Shame to anyone's lives
Living in a pastime paradise
I remember daddy's hands
Folded silently in prayer
And reaching out to hold me when I had a nightmare
You could read quite a story in the caluses and lines
Years of work and worry had left their mark behind
I remember daddy's hands
How they held my momma tight
And patted my back for something done right
There are things that i've forgotten that I loved about the man
But I'll always remember the love in daddy's hands
(chorus)
Daddy's hands
Were soft and kind when I was crying
Daddy's hands
Were hard as steel when I'd done wrong
Daddy's hands
Weren't always gentle but I've come to understand
There was always love in daddy's hands
I remember daddy's hands working til they bled
Sacrificed unselfishly just to keep us all fed
If I could do things over
I'd live my life again
And never take for granted the love in daddy's hands
(chorus)
Daddy's hands
Were soft and kind when I was crying
Daddy's hands
Were hard as steel when I'd done wrong
Daddy's hands
Weren't always gentle but I've come to understand
There was always love in daddy's hands
(repeat)
There goes my heart again
Here comes the hurt back in
You'd think I'd learn by now to let you go
With just one look from you
My heart start beating blue
Just when it's on the mend
There goes my heart again
I'd tried to talk it out of lovin' you
But my heart has a mind of its own
It won't forget you like I told it to
I wish it would leave you alone
There goes my heart again
Here comes the hurt back in
You'd think I'd learn by now to let you go
With just one look from you
My heart start beating blue
Just when it's on the mend
There goes my heart again
(Instrumental Break)
I was doin' fine for a little while
Even with no one to hold
I slowed it down til I saw your smile
Now it's racing out of control
There goes my heart again
Here comes the hurt back in
You'd think I'd learn by now to let you go
With just one look from you
My heart start beating blue
Just when it's on the mend
There goes my heart again
Just when it's on the mend
There goes my heart again
When you asked me out and I turned you down
Never thought that'd stop you from askin' now
Why'd you go and give up so easily?
I thought you'd see ...
CHORUS:
When I say no
I mean maybe
Baby, don't you know me yet?
Nothing's worth having if it ain't a little hard to get
So let me clarify so you won't have to try to guess
When I say no
I mean maybe, or maybe I mean yes
Ever since woman has talked to man
Every man's been trying to understand
What's the harm in a little mystery?
That's how it should be
CHORUS:
When I say no
I mean maybe
Baby, don't you know me yet?
Nothin's worth havin' if it ain't a little hard to get
So let me clarify so you won't have to try to guess
When I say no
I mean maybe, or maybe I mean yes
It seems like a crazy way to be
But it makes perfect sense to me
CHORUS:
When I say no I mean maybe
Baby, don't you know me yet?
Nothing's worth having' if it ain't a little hard to get
So let me clarify so you won't have to try to guess
When I say no
I mean maybe or maybe I mean yes
CHORUS: (abridged)
That dancing moon is on the water
Do you feel inclined romantically?
If you do, I think you oughtta
Love someone like me
Ain't no place you should be goin'
Ain't no need for you to leave
It's a lovers' night, the stars are showin'
You need to love someone like me
Someone else might try to find you
But my love can set you free
And if your heart has got a mind to
You could love someone like me
Instrumental break
Don't need luck to find good lovin'
And it don't happen magically
And, baby, tonight, oh, you don't need nothin
To love someone like me
If you've been thinkin' love won't find you
Well, honey, wait right here and see
And if your heart has got a mind to
You could love someone like me
You could love someone like me
You could love someone like me
To instrumental fade out
I used to love free and easy
Hitting the road any time I pleased
You came and turned me around
Now all I think about is settling down
That's what your love does to me
That's what your love does to me
Made me wonder what I ever saw in being free
I'm used to running
But my heart says stay
This time
There ain't no running away
That's what your love does to me
That's what your love does to me
Out every night when the sun goes down
Neon lights and the juke box sound
I used to be first in line now
It's the last thing on my mind
That's what your love does to me
That's what your love does to me
Made me wonder what I ever saw in being free
I'm used to running
But my heart says stay
This time
There ain't no running away
That's what your love does to me
That's what your love does to me
Every heart gets the chance to be untrue
There'll come a time when mine will, too
Well, don't you worry when it comes my time
My heart's gonna walk the line
That's what your love does to me
That's what your love does to me
Made me wonder what I ever saw in being free
I'm used to running
But my heart says stay
This time
There ain't no running away
That's what your love does to me
That's what your love does to me
I've been waiting for you, baby
You've been taking your time to long
Don't be so shy
Oww, it's alright
This is one night you can't go wrong
Are you ever gonna love me?
Are you ever gonna come around?
I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know
If you ever want to hold me
Then you gotta stop holdin out
If you're gonna love me, love me now
I see others being lovers
Will that ever be you and me?
Please don't make me wonder, baby
Yes, no, maybe
What will it be?
Are you ever gonna love me?
Are you ever gonna come around?
I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know
If you ever want to hold me
Then you gotta stop holdin out
If you're gonna love me, love me now
If you're gonna love me
Love me now
I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know
Oh, are you ever gonna love me
Then love me now
I gotta know
Strangers Again
Recorded by Holly Dunn, written by Holly Dunn and Chris Waters
Strangers again
Just like before
Not even friends
After bein' much more
Strangers again
And will be forever
It hurts when love ends
As strangers again
I always thought a stranger was
Someone I'd never met
But the one who passed me by today
I know too well to forget
We're strangers again
Back where we started
But we'll never begin
Cause we're strangers again
I always thought a stranger was
Someone I'd never met
But the one who passed me by today
I know too well to forget
We're strangers again
Back where we started
But we'll never begin
Cause we're strangers again
It hurts when love ends
As strangers again
The way that you touched me made me believe
You never love any other the way that you loved me
When you said forever I thought it was true
We'd be together our whole lives through
Well, I got to hand it to you
CHORUS:
You really had me going, stringing me along
You really had me going, baby
And now I'm gone
You put one over on me said I'm the only one
You really had me going, baby
And now I'm gone
You never thought I'd see you in town
Walking and talking and holding the new love you found
You had the laugh when the joke was on me
But you're going cry when you get to see
The way that I love when I leave
You really had me going, stringing me along
You really had me going, baby
And now I'm gone
I never saw it coming that you could do me wrong
You really had me going, baby
Oh you proved you're good with a lie
Are you that good with goodbye You really had me
You really had me going, stringing me along
You really had me going, baby
And now I'm gone
And now I'm gone, and now I'm gone
You said, "Someday we'll be together
Never to be apart again"
But sometimes, someday can take forever
And this one looks like one of them
Someday ain't any closer
(Someday)
Keeps getting farther away
I'd wait if I knew, one day I'll have you
But it's always gonna be someday
Someday ain't any closer
(Someday)
Keeps getting farther away
I'd wait if I knew, one day I'll have you
But it's always gonna be someday
Oh, it's always gonna be someday
You can't look when I walk into the room
Confused from the scent of my perfume
Tongue tied tangled up inside when I brush up close to you
You're being hard headed honey but soon you're gonna come around
You're being cold hearted darling but love is gonna wear you down
Your number's comin' up like a seven and I'm willin' to bet
You're in love with me honey you just don't know it yet
Just don't know it yet
Trust me a woman would never lie
So don't fight you're just swimming against the tide
Love's will gets stronger still the more that it's denied
You're being hard headed honey...
Love's will gets stronger still the more that it's denied
You're being hard headed honey...
If you take the train when you leave me
I'll stand on the platform and make sure you see me
By the time you get a seat
And roll on down the track
You just might change your mind
Get off and come on back
But no one takes the train anymore
No one takes the train anymore
When you really wanna go
The railway is too slow
So no one takes the train anymore
If you walk away when you leave me
I'll tell you that you're mine and make you believe me
By the time you reach the gate
And turn onto the road
I know you'd change your mind
And decide you shouldn't go
But no one walks away anymore
No one walks away anymore
When the moment has arrived
It's easier to drive
So no one walks away anymore
If you sail to sea when you leave me
I'll call out your name and tell you you need me
By the time you set the sails
And fin'ly put to sea
You'll have to change your mind
About wanting to be free
But no one sails to sea anymore
No one sails to sea anymore
When you wanna say goodbye
It's faster now to fly
So no one sails to sea anymore
Ohh no one walks away anymore
There won't be the time
For me to change your mind
'Cause no one takes the train anymore
No one takes the train anymore
Most the time
I don't ever hurt about you
I do fine without you
Most the time
I don't long to have you with me
Your memory doesn't get me
The only time that you still break my heart
Is when I'm in somebody else's arms
CHORUS
Only when I love do I think about us
And what we lost and could have had together
Only when I hold someone new
Who could never be you
I realize what's gone forever
No one else has ever touched me
Like you touched me or loved me like you loved me
When I forget
I'm reminded when I try to find another like you
I only ache for the way we felt
When I'm reaching out to someone else
CHORUS
Only when I love
I think about us
Only when I love
I think about us
Maybe I did'nt cry, when you first told me the lie
Maybe I thougth it would be big mistake
I knew teardrops would'nt help
So I kept them to myself
Thers no heart so strong it will not break
When I called you on the phone
And you we're not alone
Oh you never knew it was hard for me to take
Cause I tried my best to hide the hurt inside
There's no heart so strongit will not break
Chorus:
There's no heart so strong that it could hold it's own
When the lonliness is more then it can take
Oh you but don't ever ever think
There's a heart so strong it will not break
If she ever lets you go, then I'm sure you will know
There's no heart so strong it will not break
There's no heart so strong it will not break
You've got that lookin' around look in your eye
You've got a restless ache you wanna satisfy
But while you're thinkin' about who you could love
You'd better keep in mind just what you're giving up
Stop acting like you've already left I'm not through loving you yet
Don't you turn your back don't you act like that
Don't do anything you'd regret
I'm telling you boy
If you're thinking free think differently
And never forget I'm not through loving you yet
Just cause there's someone out there you haven't tried
Don't mean that what you want is what you're gonna find
I've always taken you where you wanna be
So don't go somewhere else for what you've got with me
I'll show you I meant it when I said I'm not through loving you yet
Don't you turn your back don't you act like that...
I'll show you I meant it when I said I'm not through loving you yet
Don't you turn your back don't you act like that...
Got a four leaf clover and my lucky charms
A piece of the rainbow too
Got a dream in my arms and I know now
That dreams can come true
You're an angel from heaven
Your smile's like the sunshine in a sky of blue
Oh, I, oh, I've got a heart full of love
A heart full of love, got a heart full of love just for you
Well, I used to be blue but now I feel brand new
Must be something you done
You put a smile on my face
And kissed away my tears
You're the light in my eyes
The sun in my skies even on cloudy days
Oh I, oh, I've got a heart full of love
A heart full of love, got a heart full of love just for you
You don't know what you do to me
Somethin' in your laughin' eyes
Is gettin' through to me
I've got a heart full of love, a heart full of love
Got a heart full of love just for you
I've got a heart full of love, a heart full of love
A heart full of love just for you
Walkin' a fine line down love's scary road
When do I hold on when do I let go
Looking back at mistakes I've made so much I would change
Cause I know how I see now it's such a simple thing
Don't break the wings of the one you love help him learn to fly
Tenderly set him free it just might last a lifetime
Yeah if you try to hold too tight it just might be too much
Don't break the wings of the one you love
Doesn't matter whose wrong or right just make room for love
You can never get enough or give too much
It's a little like dancin' sometimes fast sometimes slow
It just took time for me to find just how it goes
Don't break the wings of the one you love...
( guitar )
Don't break the wings of the one you love...
(Linda Hargrove/Chris Waters)
Love is gone but feelings linger
There's no point in pointing fingers
Finding fault where there's no fault to find
Along the way we discovered
We are better friends than lovers
Forever wasn't meant to be this time
It's not about blame
It's not about wrong
It's about change and moving on
We were just two people who weren't where they belong
Better to go our separate ways than to regret it if we stay
It's about life and love and time and us
But it's not about blame
We could stay and be mistaken
Longing for the road not taken
Or we could do the right thing and walk out
And baby there's no way of knowing
When we get out to where we're going
We may end up closer then than now
It's not about blame
It's not about wrong
It's about change and moving on
We were just two people who weren't where they belong
Better to go our separarte ways than to regret it if we stay
It's about life and love and time and us
But it's not about blame
(Holly Dunn/Tom Shapiro/Chris Waters)
I can say no to cherry pie ala mode
A Mercedes don't tempt me a bit
I can resist buying designer clothes
But heaven knows I've got to admit
Cowboys are my weakness
From L.A. to Abilene
Cowboys are my weakness
Could it be the genes
I really go for a rodeo Romeo
I gotta know what's under that hat
Show me a man who loves his old pickup truck
You gotta love somebody like that
Cowboys are my weakness
From L.A. to Abilene
Cowboys are my weakness
Could it be the jeans
They're so strong, they're so shy
A little bit wild, but so am I
I love their walk and I love their ways
Makes me wanna go yippee yo ki ay
Cowboys are my weakness
From L.A. to Abilene
Cowboys are my weakness
Oh, you know what I mean
(Mel Tillis)
A honey bee loves a flower
A chickadee loves the sky
Everybody loves somebody
But no love have I
No love have I
Standing on the corner
Lovers pass me by
How my heart is crying
Cos no love have I
No love have I
Every night in my prayers
I pray some lost love will come my way
Then we'll sepnd our lonely hours
Making love in an ivory tower
No love have I
Lonely is the city
When the moon lights up the sky
What good is that moonlight
If no love have I
No love have I
Everybody loves somebody
No love have I
Everybody loves somebody
No love have I
Whatever you want
I've been willing to try
But whatever I do
You're not satisfied
Why don't you admit that I'm not what you need
So I can find someone who'll love me for me
I am who I am
I am who I am
You've tried to remake me again and again
You can bend but not break me
I'm taking a stand
You get what you see, baby
I am who I am
I've been changing myself
From my hair to my shoes
Now I'm changing my mind about changing for you
I'll never be perfect
But I'll be all right
Now that I've started to live my own life
I am who I am
I am who I am
You've tried to remake me again and again
You can bend
But not break me I'm taking a stand
I'm all I can be, baby
I am who I am
No regrets, no apologies
I can't be right for you if it's not right for me
I am who I am
I am who I am
You've tried to remake me again and again
You can bend but not break me
I'm taking a stand
I'm nobody else, baby
I am who I am
I'm all I can be, baby
I am who I am
We once were so close now the love light
That glowed has now gone out of our eyes
And the good life we had for some reason went bad
And the love that once lived here has died
How did we get here, where did it start
When did we walk out of each other's hearts
Where did we lose it, how did love die
When, where, and how, but most of all why
Most of all, why did we let love die
Like the withering leaves in the fall
And why did we wait 'til it was to late
To realize how much we lost
How did we get here, where did it start
When did we walk out of each other's hearts
Where did we lose it, how did love die
When, where, and how, but most of all why
When, where, and how, but most of all why
Here's where I should say goodnight call me up some other time
A little kiss by the front porch light that's what I should do
Anyone with sense at all knows how far and fast to fall
The world is full of broken hearted fools
That never stopped me no I never hold back
I go playing on the railroad track
Even though there's a good chance that a freight train is bearing down
That never stopped me from falling in love
Knowing better ain't good enough
I see the light but my eyes are shut when a boy like you's around
Never stopped me before it won't stop me now
When I look into your eyes I see all the warning signs
It's too soon to cross that line I will anyway
Fools rush in where angels stop guess which one of them I'm not
Even though I know I'm tempting fate
That never stopped me...
( piano )
Don't lose your heart use your head
That's what everybody says
That never stopped me...
Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the girls in town (Girls in town)
Follow you (Follow you) all around (All around)
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Ah-ah-aaah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-aaah
On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the girls in town (Girls in town)
Follow you (Follow you) all around (All around)
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Just like me (Just like me), they long to be
Close to you

(Wua-a-a-a, close to you)
(Wua-a-a-a, close to you)
(Haa-a-a-a, close to you)
(Wua-a-a-a, close to you)


(Wua-a-a-a, close to you)
(Wua-a-a-a, close to you)
(Wua-a-a-a, close to you)
(Wua)
Such a feeling's coming over me
There is wonder in most everything I see
Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream
Everything I want the world to be
Is now coming true especially for me
And the reason is clear, it's because you are here/near
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen

I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world

Something in the wind has learned my name
And it's telling me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me
There is only one wish on my mind
When this day is through I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me
All I need will be mine if you are here
I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world
I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world
When I was young, I'd listen to the radio
Waitin' for my favorite songs
When they played, I'd sing along
It made me smile

Those were such happy times
And not so long ago
How I wondered where they'd gone
But they're back again
Just like a long-lost friend
All the songs I loved so well

Every "sha-la-la-la"
Every "whoa, whoa-oh" still shines
Every "shing-a-ling-a-ling"
That they're starting to sing so fine
When they get to the part
Where he's breaking her heart
It can really make me cry
Just like before, it's yesterday once more
(Shoobie-doo, lang, lang)
(Shoobie-doo, lang, lang)
Lookin' back on how it was in years gone by
And the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad
So much has changed

It was songs of love
That I would sing to them
And I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies
Still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away

Every "sha-la-la-la"
Every "whoa, whoa-oh" still shines
(Only oldies, but goodies)
Every "shing-a-ling-a-ling"
That they're starting to sing so fine
All my best memories
Come back clearly to me
Some can even make me cry
Just like before, it's yesterday once more
(Shoobie-doo, lang, lang)
Every "sha-la-la-la"
Every "whoa, whoa-oh" still shines
Every "shing-a-ling-a-ling"
That they're starting to sing so fine
Every "sha-la-la-la"
Every "whoa, whoa-oh" still shines
Every "shing-a-ling-a-ling"
That they're starting to sing so fine...
Long ago and oh so far away
I fell in love with you
Before the second show
Your guitar, it sounds so sweet and clear
But you're not really here
It's just the radio

Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
I love you, I really do

Loneliness is a such a sad affair
And I can hardly wait to be with you again
What to say to make you come again (Ooo baby)
Come back to me again (Ooo baby)
And play your sad guitar (Ooo)

Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
I love you, I really do
Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
I love you, I really do
We've only just begun to live
White lace and promises
A kiss for luck and we're on our way
We've only begun
Before the rising sun, we fly
So many roads to choose
We'll start out walking and learn to run
And yes, we've just begun

Sharing horizons that are new to us
Watching the signs along the way
Talkin' it over, just the two of us
Workin' together day to day, together

And when the evening comes, we smile
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow
And yes, we've just begun

Sharing horizons that are new to us
Watching the signs along the way
Talkin' it over, just the two of us
Workin' together day to day, together
And when the evening comes, we smile
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow
And yes, we've just begun

(Flute and Piano)
Talkin' to myself and feelin' old
Sometimes I'd like to quit, nothin' ever seems to fit
Hangin' around, nothin' to do but frown
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down
What I've got they used to call the blues
Nothin' is really wrong, feelin' like I don't belong
Walkin' around, some kind of lonely clown
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down
Funny, but it seems I always wind up here with you
Nice to know somebody loves me
Funny, but it seems that it's the only thing to do
Run and find the one who loves me
(The one who loves me)
What I feel has come and gone before
No need to talk it out (Talk it out)
We know what it's all about
Hangin' around (Hangin' around)
Nothin' to do but frown
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down
Funny but it seems that it's the only thing to do
(Only thing to do)
Run and find the one who loves me (Ooo)
What I feel has come and gone before
No need to talk it out (Talk it out)
We know what it's all about
Hangin' around (Hangin' around)
Nothin' to do but frown
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down
Hangin' around (Hangin' around)
Nothin' to do but frown
Rainy days and Mondays always get
Me down
You are the one who makes me happy
When everything else turns to grey
Yours is the voice that wakes me mornings
And sends me out into the day
You are the crowd that sits quiet listening to me
And all the mad sense I make
You are one of the few things
Worth remembering
And since it's all true
How could anyone mean more to me than you?
Sorry if sometimes I look past you
Theres no one beyond your eyes
Inside my head the wheels are turning
And sometimes I'm not so wise
You are my heart and my soul, my inspiration
Just like the old love song goes
You are one of the few things
Worth remembering
And since it's all true
How could anyone mean more to me than you?
You are my heart and my soul, my inspiration
Just like the old love song goes
You are one of the few things
Worth remembering
And since it's all true
How could anyone mean more to me than you?
Day after day
I must face a world of strangers
Where I don't belong
I'm not that strong
It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to
Who will always care
You're always there
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you
So many times when the city seems to be
Without a friendly face, a lonely place
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you
And you'll always smile, it's all worthwhile
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you
Touch me and I end up singing
Trouble seems to up and disappear
You touch me with the love you're bringing
I can't really lose when you're near
When you're near, my love
If all my friends have forgotten half their promises
They're not unkind, just hard to find
One look at you
And I know that I could learn to live
Without the rest
I've found the best
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you
Sing, sing a song
Sing out loud, sing out strong
Sing of good things not bad
Sing of happy not sad
Sing, sing a song
Make it simple to last your whole life long
Don't worry that it's not good enough
For anyone else to hear
Just sing, sing a song

La la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la

Sing, sing a song (Sing, sing)
Let the world sing along
Sing of love there could be (Ooo)
Sing for you and for me
Sing, sing a song (La la la la la, La la la la la la, La la la la la la la)
Make it simple to last your whole life long (La la la la la, La la la la la la)
Don't worry that it's not good enough
For anyone else to hear
Just sing, sing a song
Just sing, sing a song (Ooo)
Just sing, sing a song (Ooo)
La la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la

There's a kind of hush
All over the world tonight
All over the world
You can hear the sound of lovers in love
You know what I mean, just the two of us
And nobody else in sight
There's nobody else and I'm feeling good
Just holding you tight
So listen very carefully
Get closer now and you will see
What I mean
It isn't a dream
The only sound that you will hear
Is when I whisper in your ear
I love you
Forever and ever
There's a kind of hush
All over the world tonight
All over the world
People just like us are falling in love
So listen very carefully
Get closer now and you will see
What I mean
It isn't a dream
The only sound that you will hear
Is when I whisper in your ear
I love you
Forever and ever
There's a kind of hush
All over the world tonight
All over the world
You can hear the sound of lovers in love
The hardest thing I've ever done
Is keep believing
There's someone in this crazy world for me
The way that people come and go
Through temporary lives
My chance could come and I might never know

I used to say "No promises
Let's keep it simple"
But freedom only helps you say good-bye
It took a while for me to learn
That nothing comes for free
The price I've paid is high enough for me

I know I need to be in love
I know I've wasted too much time
I know I ask perfection of
A quite imperfect world
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find

So here I am with pockets full of good intentions
But none of them will comfort me tonight
I'm wide awake at four a.m
Without a friend in sight
Hanging on a hope but I'm alright
I know I need to be in love
I know I've wasted too much time
I know I ask perfection of
A quite imperfect world
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find
I know I need to be in love
I know I've wasted too much time
I know I ask perfection of
A quite imperfect world
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find
We fell in love
On the first night that we met
Together we've been happy
I have very few regrets
The ordinary problems
Have not been hard to face
But lately little changes
Have been slowly taking place
You're always finding something
Is wrong in what I do
But you can't rearrange my life
Because it pleases you
You've got to love me for what I am
For simply being me
Don't love me for what you intend
Or hope that I will be
And if you're only using me
To feed your fantasy
You're really not in love
So let me go, I must be free
If what you want
Isn't natural for me
I won't pretend to keep you
What I am I have to be
The picture of perfection
Is only on your mind
For all your expectations
Love can never be designed
We either take each other
For everything we are
Or leave the life we've made behind
And make another start
You've got to love me for what I am
For simply being me
Don't love me for what you intend
Or hope that I will be
And if you're only using me
To feed your fantasy
You're really not in love
So let me go, I must be free
And if you're only using me
To feed your fantasy
You're really not in love
So let me go, I must be free
You're really not in love
So let me go, I must be free

Greeting cards have all been sent
The Christmas rush is through
But I still have one wish to make
A special one for you
Merry Christmas, darling
Were apart, thats true
But I can dream and in my dreams
Im Christmasing with you
Holidays are joyful
Theres always something new
But every day is a holiday
When Im near to you
The lights on my tree
I wish you could see
I wish it every day
The logs on the fire
Fill me with desire
To see you and to say
That I wish you merry Christmas
Happy New Year too
Ive just one wish on this Christmas Eve
I wish I were with you
The logs on the fire
Fill me with desire
To see you and to say
That I wish you merry Christmas
Happy New Year too
Ive just one wish on this Christmas Eve
I wish I were with you
I wish I were with you
Merry Christmas, darling
Love, look at the two of us
Strangers in many ways
We've got a lifetime to share
So much to say
And as we go from day to day
I'll feel you close to me
But time alone will tell
Let's take a lifetime to say
I knew you well
For only time will tell us so
And love may grow
For all we know
Love (love), look at the two of us
Strangers in many ways
Let's take a lifetime to say
I knew you well
For only time will tell us so (and love may grow)
And love may grow
For all we know
(love)

Why does the sun go on shining?
Why does the sea rush to shore?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
Cause you don't love me any more.
Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do the stars glow above?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when I lost your love
I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything's the same as it was
I can't understand
No, I can't understand
How life goes on the way it does
Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when you said goodbye
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when you said goodbye
You know I can't smile without you
I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't walk
Im finding it hard even to talk
And I feel sad when you're sad
I feel glad when you're glad
And you must know what I'm going through
I just can't smile without you
You came along just like a song
You brightened my day
Who'd believe you were part of a dream
That only seemed light years away
And you know I can't smile without you
I can't smile without you
And you must know what I'm going through
I just can't smile without you
Some people say the happiness way
Is something that's hard to find
Into the new leaving the old behind me
And I feel sad when you're sad
I feel glad when you're glad
And you must know what I'm going through
I just can't smile without you
Into the new leaving the old behind me
And I feel sad when you're sad
I feel glad when you're glad
And you must know what I'm going through
I just can't smile without you
And you must know what I'm going through
I just can't smile without you
After long enough of being alone
Everyone must face their share of loneliness
In my own time nobody knew
The pain I was going through
And waiting was all my heart could do
Hope was all I had until you came
Maybe you can't see how much you mean to me
You were the dawn breaking the night
The promise of morning light
Filling the world surrounding me
And when I hold you
Baby, baby, feels like maybe
Things will be all right
Baby, baby, your love's made me
Free as a song singing forever
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday
I have found my home here in your arms
Nowhere else on earth I'd really rather be
Life waits for us, share it with me
The best is about to be
And so much is left for us to see
And when I hold you
Baby, baby, feels like maybe
Things will be all right
Baby, baby, your love's made me
Free as a song singing forever
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday
I'll say goodbye to love
No-one ever cared if I should live or die
Time and time again the chance for love has passed me by
And all I know of love is how to live without it
I just can't seem to find it
So I've made my mind up I must live my life alone
And though it's not the easy way, I guess I've always known
I'd say goodbye to love
There are no tomorrows for this heart of mine
Surely time will lose these bitter memories
And I'll find that there is someone to believe in
And to live for something I could live for
All the years of useless search have finally reached an end
Loneliness and empty days will be my only friend
From this day love is forgotten
I'll go on as best I can
What lies in the future is a mystery to us all
No one can predict the wheel of fortune as it falls
There may come a time when I will see that I've been wrong
But for now this is my song
And it's goodbye to love
I'll say goodbye to love
Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays
For no matter how far away you roam
When you long for the sunshine of a friendly gaze
For the holidays you can't beat home, sweet home
I met a man who lives in Tennessee and he was heading for
Pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie
From Pennsylvania folks are travelling down to Dixie's sunny shore
From Atlantic to Pacific, gee, the traffic is terrific
Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays
'Cause no matter how far away you roam
If you want to be happy in a million ways
For the holidays you can't beat home, sweet home

I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you
I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but, darling, can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Darling, can't you please see through me
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you
You taught me precious secrets
Of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better
And if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you
You taught me precious secrets
Of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better
And if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you
We were alone and I was singing this song for you
An angry silence stayed where love had been
And in your eyes a look I've never seen
If I had found the words you might have stayed
But as I turned to speak the music played
As lovers danced their way around the floor
I suddenly watched you walk towards the door
I heard a friend of yours suggest you stay
And as you took his hand the music played
Across the darkened room the fatal signs I saw
We'd been something more than friends before
Well, I was hurting you by clinging to my pride
He had been waiting and I drove him to your side
I couldn't say the things I should have said
Refused to let my heart control my head
But I was made to see the price I paid
And as he held you close
The music played
And as I lost your love
The music played
Questi giorni quando vieni il belle sole
La la la la la-la-la-la la la la la
On days like these when skies are blue and fields are green
I look around and think about what might have been
And then I hear sweet music float around my head
As I recall the many things we left unsaid
It's on days like these that I remember
Singing songs and drinking wine
While your eyes played games with mine
On days like these I wonder what became of you
Maybe today you're singing songs with someone new
Id like to think you're walking by those willow trees
Remembering the love we knew on days like these
It's on days like these that I remember
Singing songs and drinking wine
While your eyes played games with mine
On days like these I wonder what became of you
Maybe today you're singing songs with someone new
Questi giorni quando vieni il belle sole
La la la la la-la-la-la la la la la
Walk away, please go
Before you throw your life away
A life that I could share for just a day
We should have met some years ago
For your sake I say
Walk away, just go
Walk away, and live
A life that's full
With no regret
Don't look back at me
Just try to forget
Why build a dream that cannot come true
So be strong, reach the stars now
Walk away, walk on
If I heard your voice
I'd beg you to stay
So don't say a word
Just run, run away
Goodbye my love
My tears will fall
Now that you've gone
I can't help but cry
But I must go on
I'm sad that I after searching so long
Knew, I loved you, but I told you
Walk away, walk on, walk on
From Russia with love I fly to you
Much wiser since my good-bye to you
I've traveled the world to learn
I must return from Russia with love
I've seen places, faces and smiled for a moment
But oh, you haunted me so
Still my tongue tied young pride
Would not let my love for you show in case you'd say no
To Russia I flew but there and then
I suddenly knew you'd care again
My running around is through
I fly to you from Russia with love
There could never be a portrait of my love
For nobody could paint a dream
You will never see a portrait of my love
For miracles are never seen
Anyone who sees her soon forgets the Mona Lisa
It would take, I know, a Michelangelo
And he would need the glow of dawn that paints the sky above
To try and paint a portrait of my love
It would take, I know, a Michelangelo
And he would need the glow of dawn that paints the sky above
To try and paint a portrait of my love
Born free
As free as the wind blows
As free as the grass grows
Born free to follow your heart
Live free
And beauty surrounds you
The world still astounds you
Each time you look at a star
Stay free
Where no walls divide you
You're free as a roaring tide so there's no need to hide
Born free
And life is worth living
But only worth living
Cos you're born free

Stay free
Where no walls divide you
You're free as a roaring tide so there's no need to hide
Born free
And life is worth living
But only worth living
Cos you're born free
We were fools you and I
Now we know it
We stood still as the days moved along
Love was ours by our eyes didn't show it
Suddenly we can see we were wrong
All of a sudden this world's yours and mine
All of a sudden water tastes like wine
Now every moment there are songs to sing
All of a sudden everything
Let's not talk of all the times we've been lonely
But let us speak of the times we will know
From today I will live for you only
Wish I'd said all these things long ago
All of a sudden this world's yours and mine
All of a sudden water tastes like wine
Now every moment there are songs to sing
All of a sudden everything
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
Softly, I will leave you softly
For my heart would break if you should wake and see me go
So I leave you softly, long before you miss me
Long before your arms can beg me stay
For one more hour
Or one more day
After all the years, I can't bear the tears to fall
So softly as I leave you there
Softly, long before you miss me
Long before your arms can beg me stay
For one more hour
Or one more day
After all the years, I can't bear the tears to fall
So softly as I leave you there
As I leave I you there
As I leave I you there
If it takes forever, I will wait for you
For a thousand summers, I will wait for you
'Til you're back beside me
'Til I'm holding you
'Til I hear you sigh
Here, in my arms
Anywhere you wander, anywhere you go
Every day remember how I love you so
In your heart believe
What in my heart I know
That forevermore, I'll wait for you
The clock will tick away the hours, one-by-one
And then the time will come when all the waiting's done
The time when you return, find me here, and run
Straight to my waiting arms
If it takes forever, I will wait for you
For a thousand summers, I will wait for you
'Til you're here beside me
'Til I'm touching you
And forevermore, sharing your love
She walks like an angel walks
She talks like an angel talks
And her hair has a kind of curl
To my mind she's my kind of girl
She's wise like an angel's wise
With eyes like an angel's eyes
And her smile's kinda like a pearl
To my mind she's my kind of girl
Pretty little face
That face just knocks me off my feet
Pretty little feet
She's really sweet enough to eat
She looks like an angel looks
She cooks like an angel cooks
And my mind's in a kind of whirl
To my mind she's my kind of girl
Pretty little face
That face just knocks me off-a my feet
Pretty little feet
She's really sweet enough to eat
She looks like an angel looks
She even cooks like an angel cooks
And my mind's in a kind of whirl
To my mind she's my kind of girl
And my heart's kinda full of joy
Because she told me I'm her kind of boy
To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go
To right the unrightable wrong
To love pure and chaste from afar
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star
This is my quest To follow that star
No matter how hopeless No matter how far
To fight for the right Without question or pause
To be willing to march into hell for a heavenly cause
And I know if I'll only be true To this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest
And the world will be better for this
That one man scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable stars
She said my son I beg of you
I have a wish that must come true
The last thing you can do
For mama
Please promise me that you will stay
And take my place while I'm away
And give the children love each day
I had to cry what could I say?
How hard I tried to find the words
I prayed she would not see me cry
So much to say that should be heard
But only time to say goodbye to mama
They say in time that you will forget
Yet still today my eyes are wet
I tell myself to smile for Mama
Now soon there'll be another spring
And I will start remembering
The way she loved to hear us sing
Her favourite song 'Ave Maria'
Ave Maria
The children all have grown up now
I kept my promise to mama
I cannot guide them anymore
I've done my best all for mama
Ave Maria
Still this seems so very small
For all
She did for me
Wednesday's child is a child of woe
Wednesday's child cries alone, I know
When you smiled, just for me you smiled
For awhile I forgot I was Wednesday's child
Friday's child wins at love, they say
In your arms Friday was my day
Now you're gone, well I should have known
I am Wednesday's child, born to be alone
Now you're gone, well I should have known
I am Wednesday's child, born to be alone
Wednesday's child, born to be alone
When hearts are passing in the night, in the lonely night
Then they must hold each other tight, oh, so very tight
And take a chance that in the light, in tomorrow's light
They'll stay together
So much in love
And in the silence of the mist, of the morning mist
When lips are waiting to be kissed, longing to be kissed
Where is the reason to resist and deny a kiss
That holds a promise
Of happiness?
Though yesterday still surrounds you
With a warm and precious memory
Maybe for tomorrow
We can build a new dream for you and me
This glow we feel is something rare, something really rare
So come and say you want to share, want to really share
The beauty waiting for us there, calling for us there
That only loving
Can give the heart
When life is passing in the night, in the rushing night
A man, a woman in the night, in the lonely night
Must take a chance that in the light, in tomorrow's light
They'll be together
So much in love
Together
So much in love
So tell me
You're not afraid to take a chance, really take a chance
Let your heart begin to dance, let it sing and dance
To the music of a glance, of a fleeting glance
To the music of romance, of a new romance
Take a chance
This is the life, here's where the living is
This is the life, baby, you're there
This is the life, you've waited long enough
Girl, you've arrived. Breathe in that air
Wine and perfume
Silver and candle-light
Children make way, I'm here to stay
Nothing but class, that's how its gonna be
This is the life for me
House at the beach
Dinners at 21:00
Head waiters smile when you walk in
Hand tailored suits, shirts with your monogram
Feel of real silk next to your skin
Top of the heap(?)
First cabin all the way
How sweet the song when you belong
Nothing but class, that's how its gonna be
This is the life for me
This is the life
This is the life
This is the life
And you smiled
I thought that I had the world on the end of a string
I thought that I was a millionaire
Free as the dawn and then came the morning
I turned and I saw you there
And you smiled and you smiled
With laughter in your eyes
And you smiled and you smiled
And I was captured
Don't you know?
I'd like to stay
Now I've got something worth talking about
And you smiled and you smiled
And I was captured
And you smiled and you smiled
I was a fool not to see before
My life was empty until your love showed me
The things I've been looking for
And you smiled and you smiled
With; laughter in your eyes the world seemed to fade away
Girl I'm so crazy about you
I know I can't live without you
Once I would run when somebody said wouldn't I like to settle down?
I didn't care now I'm up in the air with my head really in the clouds
And you smiled and you smiled
With laughter in your eyes and the world seemed to fade away
And you smiled and I was captured, don't you know
And you smiled and you smiled
With laughter in your eyes and the world seemed to fade away
And you smiled and you smiled and I was captured
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
I'd like to stay
The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold
Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall
C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis
There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us Somewhere
There's a time for us
Someday a time for us
Time together with time to spare
Time to learn, time to care
Some day! Somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere
There's a place for us
A time and place for us
Hold my hand and we're halfway there
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow, Someday, Somewhere!
Some day! Somewhere
We'll find a new way of living, We'll find a way of
Forgiving
Somewhere
There's a place for us
A time and place for us
Hold my hand and we're halfway there
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow, Someday, Somewhere!
How soon the flame of love can die
How soon goodnight becomes goodbye
You're gone now, but life goes on now
And everything seems out of tune
But time can bring a change of heart
And love can make another start
Someday you may come back to me to stay
But who can say how soon?
But time can bring a change of heart
And love can make another start
Someday you may come back to me to stay
But who can say how soon?
But who can say how soon?
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
I believe in yesterday
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go, I don't know
She didn't say
I said something wrong, now I long
For yesterday
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go, I don't know
She didn't say
I must have said something wrong, now I long
For yesterday
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
'Cause I believe in yesterday
How I long
For yesterday
Come to me
Before you say goodbye
Hold me close
Before I start to cry
I will miss you more
Than you can ever know
So kiss me once again
Before you go
I long with all my heart
For you to stay with me
But I know
That this can never be
Only yesterday
You said we'd never part
And now you leave me forsaken
Along with this ache in my heart
Though our love is an ember
My darling remember
I love you so
Just kiss me once again
Before you go
Before you leave me now
Before you go
Though our love is an ember
My darling remember
I love you so
Just kiss me once again
Before you go
Before you leave me now
Before you go
I saw you smiling
As if I could forget
And we were lovers
The moment that we met
And we would wander
Content to wander
Through the golden summer
With nothing to regret
And we were happy
That moment in our lives
And through my sadness
That happiness survives
And I'll remember
As the years go by
'Til the day I die
That we were lovers
And I'll remember
As the years go by
'Til the day I die
That we were lovers
You and I
You and I
